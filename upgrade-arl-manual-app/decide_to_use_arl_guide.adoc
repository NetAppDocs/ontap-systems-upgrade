* You have a system that uses Fabric MetroCluster 4-node and 8-node configurations running ONTAP 9.8 or later.

* You have hybrid aggregates on your system. 

[NOTE]
====
* If you're upgrading a system by swapping controller modules in the same chassis, such as AFF A800 or AFF C800, NetApp strongly recommends using the upgrade procedure that link:../upgrade-arl-auto-affa900/index.html[upgrades controller models using ARL, keeping the existing system chassis and disks]. This ARL procedure includes the steps that ensure the controllers remain secure in the chassis when you're removing and installing the controllers during the upgrade procedure.

* You can use NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE), NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE), and NetApp Aggregate Encryption (NAE) with this procedure.
