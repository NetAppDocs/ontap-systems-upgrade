You must perform the following steps to prepare the nodes for upgrade.

.Steps

. Begin the controller replacement process by entering the following command in the ONTAP command line:
+
`system controller replace start -nodes _node_names_`
+
[NOTE]
====
*	Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, the automated negotiated switchover (NSO) based upgrade procedure is the default for a four-node MetroCluster FC configuration. If you are upgrading a four-node MetroCluster FC configuration, when you issue the `system controller replace start` command, you must prevent the NSO based procedure initiating by setting the `-nso` parameter to `false`:
+
`system controller replace start -nodes _node_names_ -nso false`

* The `system controller replace start` command can only be executed at the advanced privilege level:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
====
+
You will see the following output:
+
....
Warning:
1. Current ONTAP version is 9.x
Before starting controller replacement operation, ensure that the new controllers are running the version 9.x

2. Verify that NVMEM or NVRAM batteries of the new nodes are charged, and charge them if they are not. You need to physically check the new nodes to see if the NVMEM or NVRAM  batteries are charged. You can check the battery status either by connecting to a serial console or using SSH, logging into the Service Processor (SP) or Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) for your system, and use the system sensors to see if the battery has a sufficient charge.

Attention: Do not try to clear the NVRAM contents. If there is a need to clear the contents of NVRAM, contact NetApp technical support.

3. If a controller was previously part of a different cluster, run wipeconfig before using it as the replacement controller.

. Press `y`, you will see the following output:

Controller replacement operation: Prechecks in progress.
Controller replacement operation has been paused for user intervention.

The system runs the following prechecks; record the output of each precheck for use later in the procedure:

[cols="35,65"]
|===
|Precheck |Description

|Cluster Health Check
|Checks all the nodes in the cluster to confirm they are healthy.
|MCC Cluster Check
|Checks if the system is a MetroCluster configuration.
The operation automatically detects if it is a MetroCluster configuration or not and performs the specific prechecks and verification checks.
Only 4-node MetroCluster FC configuration is supported. In the case of 2-node MetroCluster configuration and 4-node MetroCluster IP configuration, the check fails.
If the MetroCluster configuration is in switched over state, the check fails.
|Aggregate Relocation Status Check
|Checks whether an aggregate relocation is already in progress.
If another aggregate relocation is in progress, the check fails.
|Model Name Check
|Checks whether the controller models are supported for this procedure.
If the models are not supported, the task fails.
|Cluster Quorum Check
|Checks that the nodes being replaced are in quorum. If the nodes are not in quorum, the task fails.
|Image Version Check
|Checks that the nodes being replaced run the same version of ONTAP.
If the ONTAP image versions are different, the task fails.
The new nodes must have the same version of ONTAP 9.x installed on them that is installed on the original nodes. If the new nodes have a different version of ONTAP installed, you need to netboot the new controllers after you install them. For instructions on how to upgrade ONTAP, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to _Upgrade ONTAP_.
|HA Status Check
|Checks if both the nodes being replaced are in a high- availability (HA) pair configuration.
If storage failover is not enabled for the controllers, the task fails.
|Aggregate Status Check
|If the nodes being replaced own aggregates for which they are not the home owner, the task fails.
The nodes should not own any non-local aggregates.
|Disk Status Check
|If any nodes being replaced have missing or failed disks, the task fails.
If any disks are missing, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to _Disk and aggregate management with the CLI_,  _Logical storage management with the CLI_, and _High Availability management_ to configure storage for the HA pair.
|Data LIF Status Check
|Checks if any of the nodes being replaced have non- local data LIFs.
The nodes should not contain any data LIFs for which they are not the home owner. If one of the nodes contains non-local data LIFs, the task fails.
|Cluster LIF Status
|Checks whether the cluster LIFs are up for both nodes. If the cluster LIFs are down, the task fails.
|ASUP Status Check
|If ASUP notifications are not configured, the task fails.
You must enable ASUP before beginning the controller replacement procedure.
|CPU Utilization Check
|Checks if the CPU utilization is more than 50% for any of the nodes being replaced.
If the CPU usage is more than 50% for a considerable period of time, the task fails.
|Aggregate Reconstruction Check
|Checks if reconstruction is occurring on any data aggregates.
If aggregate reconstruction is in progress, the task fails.
|Node Affinity Job Check
|Checks if any node affinity jobs are running.
If node affinity jobs are running, the check fails.
|===

. After the controller replacement operation is started and the prechecks are completed, the operation pauses enabling you to collect output information that you might need later when configuring node3.
+
NOTE: If you have a system with more than two cluster ports per node, such as an FAS8080 or an AFF8080 system, before you start the upgrade, you must migrate and re-home the cluster LIFs to two cluster ports per node. If you perform the controller upgrade with more than two cluster ports per node, cluster LIFs might be missing on the new controller after the upgrade.

. Run the below set of commands as directed by the controller replacement procedure on the system console.
+
From the serial port connected to each node, run and save the output of the following commands individually:
+
* `vserver services name-service dns show`
* `network interface show -curr-node _local_ -role _cluster,intercluster,node-mgmt,cluster-mgmt,data_`
* `network port show -node _local_ -type physical`
* `service-processor show -local -instance`
* `network fcp adapter show -node _local_`
* `network port ifgrp show`
* `system node show -instance -node _local_`
* `run -node _local_ sysconfig`
* `storage aggregate show -node _local_`
* `volume show -node _local_`
* `storage array config show -switch _switch_name_`
* `system license show -owner _local_`
* `storage encryption disk show`
* `security key-manager onboard show-backup`
* `security key-manager external show`
* `security key-manager external show-status`
* `network port reachability show -detail`

NOTE: If NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE) or NetApp Aggregate Encryption (NAE) using Onboard Key Manager (OKM) is in use, keep the key manager passphrase ready to complete the key manager resync later in the procedure.

. If your system uses self-encrypting drives, see the Knowledge Base article https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Data_Storage_Systems/FAS_Systems/How_to_tell_I_have_FIPS_drives_installed[How to tell I have FIPS drives installed^] to determine the type of self-encrypting drives that are in use on the HA pair that you are upgrading. ONTAP software supports two types of self-encrypting drives:
+
--
* FIPS-certified NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE) SAS or NVMe drives
* Non-FIPS self-encrypting NVMe drives (SED)

[NOTE]
====
You cannot mix FIPS drives with other types of drives on the same node or HA pair.

You can mix SEDs with non-encrypting drives on the same node or HA pair.
