You must perform the following steps to prepare the nodes for upgrade.

.Steps

. Begin the controller replacement process by entering the following command in the ONTAP command line:
+
`system controller replace start -nodes <node_names>`
+
[NOTE]
====
* This command can only be executed at the advanced privilege level:
`set -privilege advanced`

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.10.1, the automated negotiated switchover (NSO) based upgrade procedure is the default for a four-node MetroCluster FC configuration. If you are upgrading a four-node MetroCluster FC configuration, you must select `false` for the `-nso` parameter when you issue the `system controller replace start` command. If you do not select `false`, the automated NSO based procedure is initiated.

You will see the following output:

....
Warning:
1. Current ONTAP version is 9.x
Before starting controller replacement operation, ensure that the new controllers are running the version 9.x

2. Verify that NVMEM or NVRAM batteries of the new nodes are charged, and charge them if they are not. You need to physically check the new nodes to see if the NVMEM or NVRAM  batteries are charged. You can check the battery status either by connecting to a serial console or using SSH, logging into the Service Processor (SP) or Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) for your system, and use the system sensors to see if the battery has a sufficient charge.

Attention: Do not try to clear the NVRAM contents. If there is a need to clear the contents of NVRAM, contact NetApp technical support.

3. If a controller was previously part of a different cluster, run wipeconfig before using it as the replacement controller.

Controller replacement operation: Prechecks in progress.
Controller replacement operation has been paused for user intervention.

The system runs the following prechecks; record the output of each precheck for use later in the procedure:

|===
|Precheck |Description

|Cluster Health Check
|Checks all the nodes in the cluster to confirm they are healthy.
|MCC Cluster Check
|Checks if the system is a MetroCluster configuration.
The operation automatically detects if it is a MetroCluster configuration or not and performs the specific prechecks and verification checks.
Only 4-node MetroCluster FC configuration is supported. In the case of 2-node MetroCluster configuration and 4-node MetroCluster IP configuration, the check fails.
If the MetroCluster configuration is in switched over state, the check fails.
|Aggregate Relocation Status Check
|Checks whether an aggregate relocation is already in progress.
If another aggregate relocation is in progress, the check fails.
|Model Name Check
|Checks whether the controller models are supported for this procedure.
If the models are not supported, the task fails.
|Cluster Quorum Check
|Checks that the nodes being replaced are in quorum. If the nodes are not in quorum, the task fails.
|Image Version Check
|Checks that the nodes being replaced run the same version of ONTAP.
If the ONTAP image versions are different, the task fails.
The new nodes must have the same version of ONTAP 9.x installed on them that is installed on the original nodes. If the new nodes have a different version of ONTAP installed, you need to netboot the new controllers after you install them. For instructions on how to upgrade ONTAP, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _ONTAP 9 Upgrade and Revert/Downgrade Guide_.
|HA Status Check
|Checks if both the nodes being replaced are in a high- availability (HA) pair configuration.
If storage failover is not enabled for the controllers, the task fails.
|Aggregate Status Check
|If the nodes being replaced own aggregates for which they are not the home owner, the task fails.
The nodes should not own any non-local aggregates.
|Disk Status Check
|If any nodes being replaced have missing or failed disks, the task fails.
If any disks are missing, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _ONTAP 9 Disks and Aggregates Power Guide_, the _ONTAP 9 Logical Storage Management Guide_, and the _ONTAP 9 High-Availability Configuration Guide_ to configure storage for the HA pair.
|Data LIF Status Check
|Checks if any of the nodes being replaced have non- local data LIFs.
The nodes should not contain any data LIFs for which they are not the home owner. If one of the nodes contains non-local data LIFs, the task fails.
|Cluster LIF Status
|Checks whether the cluster LIFs are up for both nodes. If the cluster LIFs are down, the task fails.
|ASUP Status Check
|If ASUP notifications are not configured, the task fails.
You must enable ASUP before beginning the controller replacement procedure.
|CPU Utilization Check
|Checks if the CPU utilization is more than 50% for any of the nodes being replaced.
If the CPU usage is more than 50% for a considerable period of time, the task fails.
|Aggregate Reconstruction Check
|Checks if reconstruction is occurring on any data aggregates.
If aggregate reconstruction is in progress, the task fails.
|Node Affinity Job Check
|Checks if any node affinity jobs are running.
If node affinity jobs are running, the check fails.
|===

. After the controller replacement operation is started and the prechecks are completed,  the operation pauses allowing you to collect output information that you might need later when configuring node3.

. Run the below set of commands as directed by the controller replacement procedure on the system console.
+
You must run and save the output of the following commands individually:
+
* vserver services name-service dns show
* network interface show -curr-node <nodename> -role <cluster,intercluster,node-mgmt,cluster-mgmt,data>
* network port show -node <node_name> -type physical
* service-processor show -node * -instance
* network fcp adapter show -node <node_name>
* network port ifgrp show
* system node show -instance -node <node_name>
* run -node <node_name> sysconfig
* storage aggregate show -node <node_name>
* volume show -node <node_name>
* storage array config show -switch <switch_name>
* system license show -owner <node_name>
* storage encryption disk show
* security key-manager backup show
* security key-manager external show
* security key-manager external show-status
* reachability show -detail

NOTE: If NetApp Volume Encryption using Onboard Key Manager (OKM) is in use, keep the key- manager passphrase ready to complete the key manager resync later in the procedure.
