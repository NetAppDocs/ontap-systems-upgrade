This guide describes how to upgrade the storage controllers in an HA pair with new controllers while keeping all the existing data and disks. This is a complex procedure that should be used only by experienced administrators.

You should use this guide under the following circumstances:

* You are running ONTAP 9.8 or later.
* You do not want to add the new controllers as a new HA pair to the cluster and migrate the data using volume moves.
* You are experienced in administering ONTAP and are comfortable with the risks of working in the diagnostic privilege mode.
* If you are upgrading a MetroCluster configuration, it is a 4-node or higher FC configuration, and all nodes are running ONTAP 9.8 or later.
+
For upgrading MetroCluster IP configurations, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _MetroCluster Upgrade and Expansion Guide_.

NOTE: You can use NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE) and NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE) with this procedure.

The following table shows the supported model matrix for the controller upgrade.

|===
|Old controller |Replacement controller

|FAS8020, FAS8040, FAS8060, FAS8080
|FAS8200, FAS8300, FAS8700, FAS9000
|AFF8020, AFF8040, AFF8060, AFF8080
|AFF A300, AFF A400, AFF A700, AFF A800*
|FAS8200
|FAS8700, FAS9000, FAS8300
|AFF A300
|AFF A700, AFF A800*, AFF A400
|===

NOTE: If your controller upgrade model combination is not in the above table, contact technical support.

*For the additional steps needed for A800 systems, go to the step that references A800 in section link:set_fc_or_uta_uta2_config_on_node3.html#step23[Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node3, Step 23], or link:set_fc_or_uta_uta2_config_node4.html#step23[Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node4, Step 23].
