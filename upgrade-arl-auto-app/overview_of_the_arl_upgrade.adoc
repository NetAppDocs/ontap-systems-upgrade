| Stage | Steps

| Stage 1. Prepare for upgrade
a| . Run prechecks to verify that the operation can be performed.
. Correct aggregate ownership if a precheck fails.
. Enter the cluster-base license keys.
. Get an IP address for storage encryption.
. Manage authentication using a KMIP server.
. Manage storage encryption using an onboard key manager (OKM).
. Quiesce the SnapMirror relationships (optional).

Aggregate ownership at the end of Stage 1:

* Node1 is the home owner and current owner of the node1 aggregates.
* Node2 is the home owner and current owner of the node2 aggregates.

|Stage 2. Relocate and retire node1
a| . Relocate non-root aggregates from node1 to node2.
. Relocate non-SAN data LIFs owned by node1 to node2.
. Relocate failed or vetoed aggregates.
. Retire node1.
. Prepare for netbooting (optional).

Aggregate ownership at the end of Stage 2:

* Node2 is the current owner of node1 aggregates.
* Node2 is the home owner and current owner of node2 aggregates.

|Stage 3. Install and boot node3
a| . Install and boot node3.
. Set the FC or (converged network adapter) CNA configuration.
. Configure the FC ports.
. Check and configure the UTA/UTA2 ports.
. Verify node3 is successfully installed.
. Restore node3 network configuration.
. Move non-SAN data LIFs ownde by node 1 from node2 to node3.
. Relocate non-root aggregates owned by node1 from node2 to node3.

Aggregate ownership at the end of Stage 3:

* Node3 is the home owner and current owner of node1 aggregates.
* Node2 is the home owner and current owner of node2 aggregates.

|Stage 4. Relocate and retire node2
a| . Relocate non-root aggregates from node2 to node3.
. Relocate non-SAN data LIFs owned by node2 to node 3.
. Retire node2.

Aggregate ownership at the end of Stage 4:

* Node3 is the home owner and current owner of aggregates that originally belonged to node1.
* Node2 is the home owner of node2 aggregates.
* Node3 is the current owner of node2 aggregates.

|Stage 5. Install and boot node4
a| . Install and boot node4.
. Set the FC or CNA configuration on node4.
. Configure the FC ports.
. Check and configure the UTA/UTA2 ports.
. Verify node4 is successfully installed.
. Restore node4 network configuration
. Relocate non-SAN data LIFs owned by node2 from node3 to node4 and verify the SAN LIFs on node4.

Aggregate ownership at the end of Stage 5:

* Node3 is the home owner and current owner of the aggregates that originally belonged to node1.
* Node4 is the home owner and current owner of aggregates that originally belonged to node2.

|Stage 6. Complete the upgrade
a| . Verify the system is set up correctly.
. Set up Storage Encryption on the new controller module.
. Set up NetApp Volume Encryption on the new control module.
. Decommission the old system.
. Resume NetApp SnapMirror operations, if needed.
