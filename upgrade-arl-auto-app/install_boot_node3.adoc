a|Manually configure the connection by using the following command at the boot environment prompt:
`ifconfig e0M -addr=_filer_addr_ -mask=_netmask_ -gw=_gateway_ -dns=_dns_addr_ -domain=_dns_domain_`

`_filer_addr_` is the IP address of the storage system (mandatory).
`_netmask_` is the network mask of the storage system (mandatory).
`_gateway_` is the gateway for the storage system (mandatory).
`_dns_addr_` is the IP address of a name server on your network (optional).
`_dns_domain_` is the Domain Name Service (DNS) domain name (optional).

NOTE: Other parameters might be necessary for your interface. Enter `help ifconfig` at the firmware prompt for details.

NOTE: If you have not already done so earlier in the procedure, see the Knowledge Base article https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/Hardware/How_to_tell_if_a_drive_is_FIPS_certified[How to tell if a drive is FIPS certified^] to determine the type of self-encrypting drives that are in use.

|If the following drives are in use…	|Then…

|NSE drives that conform to FIPS 140-2 Level 2 self-encryption requirements
|`setenv bootarg.storageencryption.support *true*`

|NetApp non-FIPS SEDs
|`setenv bootarg.storageencryption.support *false*`

[NOTE]
====
You cannot mix FIPS drives with other types of drives on the same node or HA pair.
You can mix SEDs with non-encrypting drives on the same node or HA pair.

Enter the passphrase and the backup information that you recorded earlier procedure. See link:manage_storage_encryption_using_okm.html[Manage storage encryption using the Onboard Key Manager].

If you don't have an FC or UTA/UTA2 configuration, perform link:reassign-node2-disks-to-node4.html#reassign-node1-node3-app-step1[Reassign node1 disks to node3, Step 1] so that node3 can recognize node1's disks.

. [[step29]]For a MetroCluster configuration, V-Series systems and systems with FlexArray Virtualization software connected to storage arrays,  you must set and configure the FC or UTA/UTA2 ports on node3 to detect the disks attached to the node.
To complete this task, go to section link:set_fc_or_uta_uta2_config_on_node3.html[Set the FC or UTA/UTA2 configuration on node3].
