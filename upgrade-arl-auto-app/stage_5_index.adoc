During Stage 5, you install and boot node4, check that the cluster and node-management ports from node2 come online on node4, and verify the node4 installation. If you are using NVE, you restore key-manager configuration. If required, you set the FC or UTA/UTA2 configuration on node4. You also relocate node2 NAS data LIFs and non-root aggregates from node3 to node4 and verify that the SAN LIFs exist on node4.
