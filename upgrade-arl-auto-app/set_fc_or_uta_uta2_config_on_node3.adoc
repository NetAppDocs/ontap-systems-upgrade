* If node3 does not have onboard FC ports, onboard UTA/UTA2 ports, or a UTA/UTA2 card, and you are upgrading a system with storage disks, you can skip to the link:verify_node3_installation.html[Verify the node 3 installation] section.
* However, if you have a V-Series system or a system with FlexArray Virtualization software with storage arrays, and node3 does not have onboard FC ports, onboard UTA/UTA ports, or a UTA/UTA2 card, return to the section _Install and boot node3_ and resume the section at link:install_boot_node3.html#step23[Step 23].

NOTE: In the above console output example, ONTAP will prompt you for the partner node name if the system uses Advanced Disk Partitioning (ADP) disks.

. [[step16]]If the system goes into a reboot loop with the message `no disks found`, it indicates that the system has reset the FC or UTA/UTA2 ports back to the target mode and therefore is unable to see any disks. To resolve this continue with <<auto_check3_step17,Step 17>> to <<auto_check3_step22,Step 22>>, or go to section link:verify_node3_installation.html[Verify the node3 installation].
