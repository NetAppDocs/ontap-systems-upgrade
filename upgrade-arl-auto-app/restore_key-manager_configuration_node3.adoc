If you are using NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE) to encrypt volumes on the system you are upgrading, the encryption configuration must be synchronized to the new nodes. If you do not restore key-manager, when you relocate the node1 aggregates from node2 to node3 by using ARL, encrypted volumes will be taken offline.
