Before you can replace node1 with node3, you must move the non-root aggregates and NAS data LIFs from node1 to node2 before eventually moving node1's resources to node3.

.Before you begin

The operation should already be paused when you begin the task; you must manually resume the operation.

.About this task

After the aggregates and LIFs are migrated, the operation is paused for verification purposes. At this stage, you must verify whether or not all the non-root aggregates and non-SAN data LIFs are migrated to node3.

[start=5]
. [[step5]]If any LIFs are down, set the administrative status of the LIFs to `up` by using the following command, once for each LIF:
+
`network interface modify -vserver _vserver_name_ -lif _LIF_name_ -home-node _nodename_ -status-admin up`
