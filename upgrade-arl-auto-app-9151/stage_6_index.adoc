During Stage 6, you confirm that the new nodes are set up correctly and, if the new nodes are encryption-enabled, you configure and set up Storage Encryption or NetApp Volume Encryption. You should also decommission the old nodes and resume the SnapMirror operations.

[NOTE]
====
The FAS70, FAS90, AFF A70, AFF A90, and AFF A1K systems share 100GbE network ports for both cluster and HA connections. These systems can support 10GbE or 25GbE cluster connections to legacy cluster switches; however, NetApp recommends updating to 100GbE cluster speeds when the 10GbE and 25GbE switches are no longer required.
