During Stage 3, you install and boot node3, check that the cluster and node-management ports from node1 come online on node3, and verify the node3 installation. If you are using NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE), you restore key-manager configuration. If required, you set the FC or UTA/UTA2 configuration on node3. You also relocate the node1 NAS data LIFs and non-root aggregates from node2 to node3 and verify that the SAN LIFs exist on node3.
