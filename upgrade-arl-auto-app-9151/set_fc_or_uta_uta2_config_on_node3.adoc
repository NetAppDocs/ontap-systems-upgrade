* If node3 does not have onboard FC ports, onboard UTA/UTA2 ports, or a UTA/UTA2 card, and you are upgrading a system with storage disks, you can skip to the link:verify_node3_installation.html[Verify the node3 installation] section.
* However, if you have a V-Series system or a system with FlexArray Virtualization software with storage arrays, and node3 does not have onboard FC ports, onboard UTA/UTA ports, or a UTA/UTA2 card, return to the section _Install and boot node3_ and resume the section at link:install_boot_node3.html#auto_install3_step23[Step 23].

== Configure FC ports on node3

If node3 has FC ports, either onboard or on an FC adapter, you must set port configurations on the node before you bring it into service because the ports are not preconfigured. If the ports are not configured, you might experience a disruption in service.

.Before you begin

You must have the values of the FC port settings from node1 that you saved in the section link:prepare_nodes_for_upgrade.html[Prepare the nodes for upgrade].

.About this task

You can skip this section if your system does not have FC configurations. If your system has onboard UTA/UTA2 ports or a UTA/UTA2 card, you configure them in <<Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node3>>.

. Compare the FC settings on node3 with the settings that you captured earlier from node1.
. In maintenance mode (option 5 at boot menu), modify the FC ports on node3 as needed:
+
* To program target ports:
+
`ucadmin modify -m fc -t target _adapter_`
+
* To program initiator ports:
+
`ucadmin modify -m fc -t initiator _adapter_`
+
Where `-t` is the FC4 type: target or initiator.

. Exit Maintenance mode:
+
`halt`

. Boot the system from loader prompt:
+
`boot_ontap menu`

. After you enter the command, wait until the system stops at the boot environment prompt.

. Select option `5` from the boot menu for maintenance mode.

. [[auto_check3_step8]]Take one of the following actions:
+
* If node3 has a UTA/UTA2 card or UTA/UTA2 onboard ports, go to the section <<Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node3>>.
+
* If node3 does not have a UTA/UTA2 card or UTA/UTA2 onboard ports, skip the section <<Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node3>> and go to the section link:verify_node3_installation.html[Verify the node3 installation].

== Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node3

If node3 has onboard UTA/UTA2 ports or a UTA/UTA2 card, you must check the configuration of the ports and possibly reconfigure them, depending on how you want to use the upgraded system.

.Before you begin

You must have the correct SFP+ modules for the UTA/UTA2 ports.

.About this task

If you want to use a Unified Target Adapter (UTA/UTA2) port for FC, you must first verify how the port is configured.

NOTE: NetApp marketing materials might use the term UTA2 to refer to CNA adapters and ports. However, the CLI uses the term CNA.

You can use the `ucadmin show` command to verify the current port configuration:

....
*> ucadmin show
         Current  Current    Pending   Pending      Admin
Adapter  Mode     Type       Mode      Type         Status
-------  -------  -------    --------  ----------   --------
0e      fc        target     -         initiator    offline
0f      fc        target     -         initiator    offline
0g      fc        target     -         initiator    offline
0h      fc        target     -         initiator    offline
1a      fc        target     -         -            online
1b      fc        target     -         -            online
6 entries were displayed.
....

UTA/UTA2 ports can be configured into native FC mode or UTA/UTA2 mode. FC mode supports FC initiator and FC target; UTA/UTA2 mode allows concurrent NIC and FCoE traffic sharing the same 10GbE SFP+ interface and supports FC targets.

UTA/UTA2 ports might be found on an adapter or on the controller, and have the following configurations, but you should check the configuration of the UTA/UTA2 ports on the node3 and change it, if necessary:

* UTA/UTA2 cards ordered when the controller is ordered are configured before shipment to have the personality you request.
* UTA/UTA2 cards ordered separately from the controller are shipped with the default FC target personality.
* Onboard UTA/UTA2 ports on new controllers are configured before shipment to have the personality you request.
+
WARNING: *Attention*: If your system has storage disks, you enter the commands in this section at the cluster prompt unless directed to enter Maintenance mode. If you have a V- Series system or have FlexArray Virtualization Software and are connected to storage arrays, you enter commands in this section at the Maintenance mode prompt. You must be in Maintenance mode to configure UTA/UTA2 ports.

.Steps

. [[step1]]Check how the ports are currently configured by entering the following command on node3.
+
The system displays output similar to the following example:
+
....
*> ucadmin show
         Current  Current     Pending   Pending    Admin
Adapter  Mode     Type        Mode      Type       Status
-------  -------  ---------   -------   --------   ---------
0e      fc        initiator   -         -          online
0f      fc        initiator   -         -          online
0g      cna       target      -         -          online
0h      cna       target      -         -          online
0e      fc        initiator   -         -          online
0f      fc        initiator   -         -          online
0g      cna       target      -         -          online
0h      cna       target      -         -          online
*>
....

. [[step2]]If the current SFP+ module does not match the desired use, replace it with the correct SFP+ module.
+
Contact your NetApp representative to obtain the correct SFP+ module.

. [[step3]]Examine the output of the `ucadmin show` command and determine whether the UTA/UTA2 ports have the personality you want.
. [[step4]]Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===
|If the UTA/UTA2 ports... |Then…

|Do not have the personality that you want
|Go to <<auto_check3_step5,Step 5>>.

|Have the personality that you want
|Skip Step 5 through Step 12 and go to <<auto_check3_step13,Step 13>>.
|===

. [[auto_check3_step5]]Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===
|If you are configuring... |Then…

|Ports on a UTA/UTA2 card
|Go to <<auto_check3_step7,Step 7>>
|Onboard UTA/UTA2 ports
|Skip Step 7 and go to <<auto_check3_step8,Step 8>>.
|===

. [[step6]]If the adapter is in initiator mode, and if the UTA/UTA2 port is online, take the UTA/UTA2 port offline:
+
`storage disable adapter _adapter_name_`
+
Adapters in target mode are automatically offline in Maintenance mode.

. [[auto_check3_step7]]If the current configuration does not match the desired use, change the configuration as needed:
+
`ucadmin modify -m fc|cna -t initiator|target _adapter_name_`
+
** `-m` is the personality mode, `fc` or `cna`.
** `-t` is the FC4 type, `target` or `initiator`.

. [[auto_check3_step8]]Verify the settings:
+
`ucadmin show`
+
The output in the following examples shows that the FC4 type of adapter "1b" is changing to `initiator` and that the mode of adapters "2a" and "2b" is changing to `cna`:
+
....
*> ucadmin show
         Current    Current     Pending  Pending     Admin
Adapter  Mode       Type        Mode     Type        Status
-------  --------   ----------  -------  --------    --------
1a       fc         initiator   -        -           online
1b       fc         target      -        initiator   online
2a       fc         target      cna      -           online
2b       fc         target      cna      -           online
*>
....

. [[step10]]Place any target ports online by entering one of the following commands, once for each port:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===
|If the system... |Then…

|Has storage disks
|`network fcp adapter modify -node _node_name_ -adapter _adapter_name_ -state up`
|Is a V-Series system or has FlexArray Virtualization Software and is connected to storage arrays
|`fcp config _adapter_name_ up`
|===

. [[step11]]Cable the port.
