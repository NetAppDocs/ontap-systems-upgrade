This content describes how to upgrade the storage controllers in an HA pair with new controllers while keeping the existing data and disks. This is a complex procedure that should be used only by experienced administrators.

You can use this content under the following circumstances:

* You are running ONTAP 9.15.1 or later.
* You do not want to add the new controllers as a new HA pair to the cluster and migrate the data using the volume move procedure.
* You are experienced in administering ONTAP and are comfortable with the risks of working in the diagnostic privilege mode.

NOTE: You can use NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE), NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE), and NetApp Aggregate Encryption (NAE) with this procedure.

[[sys_commands_9151_supported_systems]]The following table shows the supported model matrix for the controller upgrade.

|===
|Old controller |Replacement controller

|AFF A300
|AFF A70^1^, AFF A90^1^, and AFF A1K

|AFF A400
|AFF A70^1^, AFF A90^1^, and AFF A1K

|AFF A700
|AFF A70^1^, AFF A90^1^, and AFF A1K

|AFF A900
|AFF A90^1^ and AFF A1K

|===

NOTE: If your controller upgrade model combination is not in the above table, contact technical support.

^1^ AFF A70 and AFF A90 are integrated systems with onboard disks and the two controllers and disks in a single chassis. To upgrade from an existing model, the new controllers cannot have internal drives.
