This procedure describes how to upgrade the storage controllers in an HA pair with new controllers while keeping the existing data and disks. This is a complex procedure that should be used only by experienced administrators.

You can use this procedure under the following circumstances:

* You are running ONTAP 9.15.1 or later.
* You do not want to add the new controllers as a new HA pair to the cluster and migrate the data using the volume move procedure.
* You are experienced in administering ONTAP and are comfortable with the risks of working in the diagnostic privilege mode.

NOTE: You can use NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE), NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE), and NetApp Aggregate Encryption (NAE) with this procedure.

You cannot use this procedure under the following circumstances:

* You are upgrading an AFF A800 to an AFF A70 or AFF A90. To perform this AFF A800 upgrade, see link:other_references.html[References] to link to _Use "system controller replace" commands to upgrade controller models in the same chassis_.
* You are upgrading a V-Series system or FlexArray Virtualization storage system using an external array for backend storage. Contact technical support for options to upgrade a V-series or FlexArray system.
* You are upgrading a MetroCluster FC or IP configuration. To upgrade a MetroCluster configuration, see link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _MetroCluster Upgrade and Expansion documentation_.

[[sys_commands_9151_supported_systems]]The following table shows the supported model matrix for the controller upgrade.

|===
|Existing controller |Replacement controller

|AFF A300
|AFF A70, AFF A90, and AFF A1K

|AFF A400
|AFF A70, AFF A90, and AFF A1K

|AFF A700
|AFF A70, AFF A90, and AFF A1K

|AFF A900
|AFF A90 and AFF A1K

|===

[NOTE]
====
The AFF A70 and AFF A90 are integrated systems with onboard disks. The two controllers and disks are in a single chassis. You cannot upgrade an existing system if the new controllers have internal drives.

If your controller upgrade model combination is not in the above table, contact technical support.
