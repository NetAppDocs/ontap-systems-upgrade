You can upgrade controller hardware without disruption by using aggregate relocation (ARL). For other methods of upgrading your controller hardware, see link:../upgrade/upgrade-decide-to-use-this-guide.html[Upgrade by moving volumes or storage].

Using ARL, you nondisruptively upgrade the controller hardware on a pair of nodes running ONTAP by migrating non-root aggregates from the original nodes to the new nodes in the same cluster. The data hosted on the nodes that are being upgraded is accessible during the upgrade.

ARL takes advantage of the HA configuration to give you the capability to move ownership of non-root aggregates from one node to another if they share storage within the same cluster.

There are several ARL methods for upgrading controller hardware. To select the appropriate procedure, review the following information on the systems and ONTAP versions supported for each ARL upgrade option. 

== Use "system controller replace" commands with ONTAP 9.15.1 or later

If your upgrade scenario is listed in the following supported systems matrix, go to link:../upgrade-arl-auto-app-9151/index.html[Use "system controller replace" commands to upgrade controller hardware introduced in ONTAP 9.15.1] to start the upgrade procedure.

== Use manual ARL commands

If your upgrade scenario is not supported using "system commands", you can perform an ARL upgrade using manual commands.

Choose the procedure for your ONTAP version to start the upgrade:

* link:../upgrade-arl-manual-app/index.html[Manually upgrade controller hardware running ONTAP 9.8 or later]
* link:../upgrade-arl-manual/index.html[Manually upgrade controller hardware running ONTAP 9.7 or earlier]
