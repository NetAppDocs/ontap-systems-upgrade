If the cluster is in a SAN environment, you must delete any SAN LIFs from the original nodes before you can unjoin the original nodes from the cluster.

.Steps
. If you have iSCSI initiators, complete the following steps:
.. Display a list of active initiators currently connected to an SVM on the original nodes, once for each of the old LIFs: +
 `iscsi connection show -vserver <Vserver_name> -lif <old_lif>`
+
The following example shows the output of the command with an active initiator connected to SVM vs1:
+
----
cluster::> iscsi connection show -vserver vs1 -lif data2
          Tpgroup        Conn  Local           Remote          TCP Recv
Vserver   Name     TSIH  ID    Address         Address         Size
--------- -------- ----- ----- --------------- --------------- --------
vs1       data         9     1 10.229.226.166  10.229.136.188    131400
----

 .. If any initiators are still logged in to an original node, log out of the sessions from your host computer.
. Display the port set list to determine if any iSCSI or FC LIFs on the original nodes belong to a port set:
+
`lun portset show`
+
The following example shows output of the `lun portset show` command:
+
----
cluster:> lun portset show
Virtual
Server    Portset      Protocol Port Names              Igroups
--------- ------------ -------- ----------------------- ------------
js11      ps0          mixed    LIF1,                   igroup1
                                LIF2
          ps1          iscsi    LIF3                    igroup2
          ps2          fcp      LIF4                    -
3 entries were displayed.
----

. If any iSCSIs or FC LIFs on an original node are members of a port set, remove them from the port set:
+
`lun portset remove -vserver <vserver_name> -portset <portset_name> -port-name <lif_name>`
. Delete the LIFs on the original nodes:
+
`network interface delete -vserver <vserver_name> -lif <lif_name>`
