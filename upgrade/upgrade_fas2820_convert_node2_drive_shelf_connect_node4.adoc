Convert FAS2820 node2 to a DS212C drive shelf and then connect to node4 before reassigning drives from node2 to node4. Node1 and node2 are the reference controllers inside the DS212C shelf.

.Steps
. Disconnect all the network cables from node2.
. Remove node2 from the FAS2820 chassis.
. Insert the IOM12 or IOM12B module into the bay of node2.
. Cable the node4 serial-attached SCSI (SAS) port to an available port on the IOM12 or IOM12B module. See the link:https://hwu.netapp.com[Hardware Universe^] to verify the SAS ports for your system. 

. Create temporary cluster connections by connecting node1 ports e0a and e0b to any two 25GbE ports on node4.
+
NOTE: If node4 only supports 10GbE cluster connections, you must have 10GbE cabling to create temporary cluster connections.
