After converting AFF A250 node1 to an NS224 drive shelf and connecting to AFF A400 node3, you must reassign the drives that previously belonged to node1 to node3.

.Steps
. At the LOADER prompt, boot node3 into Maintenance Mode:
+
`boot_ontap maint` 
. Show the state of the 100GbE interfaces: 
+
`storage port show`
. Set the 100GbE interfaces to storage ports:
+
`storage port modify -p e0c -m storage`
+
`storage port modify -p e0d -m storage`
. Verify the mode changes to the 100GbE interfaces:
+ 
`storage port show` 
. Display all attached drives:
+
`disk show -v` 
. Record the local system ID value; this is the system ID of node3. Also record the system IDs of node1 and node2 from the "OWNER" column. 
. Reassign all drives from node1 to node3:
+
`disk reassign -s _node1_system_ID_ -d _node3_system_ID_ -p _node4_system_ID_`
. Verify that all reassigned drives are viewable to the new system ID:
+
`disk show -s _node3_system_ID_`
+
NOTE: If drives are not viewable, *STOP* and contact technical support for assistance.
. Exit Maintenance Mode: 
+
`halt`
