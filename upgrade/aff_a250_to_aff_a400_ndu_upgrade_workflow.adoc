You can perform a nondisruptive upgrade from a NetApp AFF A250 system to an AFF A400 system by converting each AFF A400 node to an NS224 drive shelf and then connecting to the replacement nodes in the AFF A400.

In this procedure, the AFF A250 high-availability (HA) pair controllers are called node1 and node2, and the replacement AFF A400 HA pair controllers are called node3 and node4.
