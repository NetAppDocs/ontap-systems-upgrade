Convert FAS2820 node1 to a DS212C drive shelf and then connect to node3 before reassigning drives from node1 to node3.

.Steps
. Disconnect all network cables from node1.
. Remove node1 from the FAS2820 chassis.
. Insert the IOM12 or IOM12B module into the bay of node1.
. Cable the node3 SAS port to an available port on the IOM12 or IOM12B module. See the link:https://hwu.netapp.com[Hardware Universe^] to verify the SAS ports for your system. See the link:https://hwu.netapp.com[Hardware Universe^] to verify the SAS ports for your system. 

. Create temporary cluster connections by connecting the node4 cluster ports to any cluster ports on node3.
+
NOTE: If node3 only supports 10GbE cluster connections, you must have 10GbE cabling to create temporary cluster connections.
