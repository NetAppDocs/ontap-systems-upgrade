If your original node is one of the supported models, during the process of upgrading by moving storage you can convert the node to a drive shelf and then attach it to the new nodes in the same cluster.

.Before you begin

You must have reviewed link:upgrade_considerations.md#[Considerations for upgrading controller hardware] about converting a node to a drive shelf. You should contact technical support if you need guidance specific to your configuration.

.Steps
. Replace the controller modules in the node you are converting with appropriate IOM modules.

. Set the drive shelf ID.
+
Each drive shelf, including the chassis, requires a unique ID.

. Reset other drive shelf IDs as needed.
. Turn off power to any drive shelves connected to the new nodes, and then turn off power to the new nodes.
. Cable the converted drive shelf to a SAS port on the new system, and, if you are using out-of-band ACP cabling, to the ACP port on the new node.
. Turn on the power to the converted drive shelf and any other drive shelves attached to the new nodes.
. Turn on the power to the new nodes, and then interrupt the boot process on each node by pressing Ctrl-C to access the boot environment prompt.
