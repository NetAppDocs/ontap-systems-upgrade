Convert AFF A250 node2 to an NS224 drive shelf and then connect to AFF A400 node4 before reassigning drives from node2 to node4.

.Steps
. Power off node2.
. Disconnect all the network cables from node2.
. Remove node2 from the AFF A250 chassis.
. Insert the NVMe shelf module (NSM) into the bay of node2.
. Connect the NSM to node4.

. Cable a node4 100GbE port to an available NSM port by performing one of the following connections:
+
* Cable a node4 100GbE port e0c to an NSM port e0c.
* Cable a node4 100GbE port e0d to an NSM port e0d.
. Connect the 25GbE cabling from node2 ports e0c and e0d to any two 25GbE onboard ports (e0e, e0f, e0g, or e0h) on node4.
+
NOTE: If 25GbE onboard ports are not present on node4, you can use a 25GbE PCIe adapter to make the connection.

. If the AFF A400 system uses FC ports as onboard ports, install a 25Gb Ethernet adapter into each node for cluster connectivity during migration:
.. Connect the HA pair cables between the AFF A400 nodes using ports e0a and e0b.
.. Connect the cluster cables between the AFF A400 nodes using ports e3a and e3b.
