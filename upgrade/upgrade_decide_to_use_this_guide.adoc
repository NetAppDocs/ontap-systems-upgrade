This guide describes how to upgrade controller hardware of an AFF system or a FAS system in a cluster by moving storage or volumes.

You should use this guide if you want to upgrade controller hardware in the following situations:

NOTE: The hardware upgrade procedures have been simplified in ONTAP 9.8 with the introduction of the automatic port placement feature.

* Your original and new nodes are compatible and supported.
* You are upgrading a pair of nodes running ONTAP 9.0 or later to a new pair of nodes running the same release.
* You are reusing the IP addresses, network masks, and gateways of the original nodes on the new nodes.
* You plan to upgrade controller hardware by moving storage or moving volumes.
* You are prepared to perform a disruptive procedure if you are upgrading by moving storage.
+
Upgrading by moving volumes is nondisruptive.

* You plan to convert a node of a supported model to a disk shelf, and then attach it to the new nodes.

If you are upgrading a two-node MetroCluster configuration, you must use the procedure in the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/upgrade/index.html[MetroClusterÂ® Upgrade and Expansion Guide].

This guide does not describe how to use aggregate relocation to upgrade controller hardware, which is described in the following guides:

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems-upgrade/upgrade-arl-auto-app/index.html[Use "system controller replace" commands to upgrade controller hardware running ONTAP 9.8 or later^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems-upgrade/upgrade-arl-auto/index.html[Use "system controller replace" commands to upgrade controller hardware running ONTAP 9.5 to ONTAP 9.7^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems-upgrade/upgrade-arl-manual-app/index.html[Use aggregate relocation to manually upgrade controller hardware running ONTAP 9.8 and later^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-systems-upgrade/upgrade-arl-manual/index.html[Use aggregate relocation to manually upgrade controller hardware running ONTAP 9.7 and earlier^]

If you are replacing an individual component, see the field-replaceable unit (FRU) flyer for that component.

[NOTE]
====
In the steps for upgrading controller hardware by moving storage, the original nodes are called node1 and node2, and the new nodes are called node3 and node4. During the described procedure, node1 is replaced by node3, and node2 is replaced by node4.

====

The terms node1, node2, node3, and node4 are used only to distinguish between the original and new nodes. When following the procedure, you must substitute the real names of your original and new nodes. However, in reality, the names of the nodes do not change: node3 has the name node1, and node4 has the name node2 after the controller hardware is upgraded.
