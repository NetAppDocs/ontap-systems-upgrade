[.lead]
You can perform a nondisruptive upgrade of a NetApp FAS2820 by converting each node to a DS212C drive shelf and then connecting it to the replacement nodes.

.About this task
In this procedure, the FAS2820 high-availability (HA) pair controllers are called node1 and node2, and the replacement HA 
pair controllers are called node3 and node4.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Before converting FAS2820 node2 to a drive shelf, you migrate the logical interfaces (LIFs) and data aggregates on node2 to node1.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You convert FAS8280 node2 to a DS212C drive shelf and then connect to node4 before reassigning drives from node2 to node4.
