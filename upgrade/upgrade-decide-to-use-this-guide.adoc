This content describes how to upgrade the controller hardware of an AFF, FAS, or ASA system in a cluster by moving storage or volumes.

Use this procedure if you want to upgrade controller hardware in the following situations:

[NOTE] 
====
When you upgrade to an AFF A70, AFF A90, or AFF A1K system introduced in ONTAP 9.15.1, ONTAP converts the storage efficiency of all existing thin-provisioned volumes, including those not using storage efficiency, and applies the new storage efficiency features that make use of the hardware offload functionality. This is an automatic background process, with no visible performance impact to the system. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/concepts/builtin-storage-efficiency-concept.html[Learn more^].

The hardware upgrade procedures have been simplified in ONTAP 9.8 with the introduction of the automatic port placement feature.
====

* Your original and new nodes are compatible and supported.
* The original and new nodes are running ONTAP 9.0 or later. NetApp recommends, when possible, that you have the same ONTAP version running on the original and new nodes.
+
If your controller upgrade includes mixed ONTAP versions, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/upgrade/concept_mixed_version_requirements.html[Mixed version ONTAP clusters^] for more information.
* You are reusing the IP addresses, network masks, and gateways of the original nodes on the new nodes.
* You plan to upgrade controller hardware by moving storage or moving volumes.
* You are prepared to perform a disruptive procedure if you are upgrading by moving storage.
+
Upgrading by moving volumes is nondisruptive.

* You plan to convert a node of a supported model to a disk shelf, and then attach it to the new nodes.


If you are upgrading a MetroCluster configuration, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/upgrade/concept_choosing_an_upgrade_method_mcc.html[Upgrade, refresh, or expand the MetroCluster configuration^].
