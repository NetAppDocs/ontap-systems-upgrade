[.lead]
You can perform a nondisruptive upgrade from a NetApp AFF A250 system to an NetApp AFF A400 system by converting each AFF A250 node to an NS224 drive shelf and then connecting to the AFF A400 replacement nodes.

.About this task
In this procedure, the AFF A250 high-availability (HA) pair controllers are called node1 and node2, and the replacement AFF A400 HA pair controllers are called node3 and node4.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Before converting AFF A250 node2 to a drive shelf, you migrate the logical interfaces (LIFs) and data aggregates on node2 to node1.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You convert AFF A250 node2 to an NS224 drive shelf and then connect to AFF A400 node4 before reassigning drives from node2 to node4.
