Convert node 1 (AFF A250) to an NS224 drive shelf and then connect to node3 (AFF A400) before reassigning drives from node1 to node3.

.Steps
. Disconnect all network cables from node1.
. Remove node1 from the enclosure.
. Insert the NVMe shelf module (NSM) into the bay of node1.
. Connect the NSM to node3. Refer to the NS224 shelf connectivity diagram.
. Cable a node3 100GbE port (e0c or e0d) to an available port on the NSM.
. Connect the 25GbE cabling from ports e0c & e0d on node1 to any two 25GbE onboard ports (e0e, e0f, e0g, or e0h) on node3.
+
NOTE: If 25GbE onboard ports are not present on node3, you can use a 25GbE PCIe adapter to make the connection.
