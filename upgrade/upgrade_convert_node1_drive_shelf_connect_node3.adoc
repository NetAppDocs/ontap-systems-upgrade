Convert AFF A250 node1 to an NS224 drive shelf and then connect to AFF A400 node3 before reassigning drives from node1 to node3.

.Steps
. Disconnect all network cables from node1.
. Remove node1 from the AFF A250 chassis.
. Insert the NVMe shelf module (NSM) into the bay of node1.
. Connect the NSM to node3 by cabling node3 100GbE port e0c to port e0a on NSM B.

. Connect the 25GbE cabling from node1 ports e0c and e0d to any two 25GbE onboard ports (e0e, e0f, e0g, or e0h) on node3.
+
NOTE: If 25GbE onboard ports are not present on node3, you can use a 25GbE PCIe adapter to make the connection.
