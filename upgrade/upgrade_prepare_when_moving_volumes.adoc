You need to perform a few preparation steps before upgrading controller hardware by moving volumes.

.Steps
. Display the volumes on the original nodes:
+
`volume show`
+
You use the command output to prepare the list of volumes to move to the new nodes.

. Display and record license information from the original nodes:
+
`system license show`

. If you use Storage Encryption on the original nodes and the new nodes have encryption-enabled disks, make sure that the original nodes' disks are correctly keyed:
.. Display information about self-encrypting disks (SEDs):
+
`storage encryption disk show`
.. If any disks are associated with a non-manufacture secure ID (non-MSID) key, rekey them to an MSID key:
+
`storage encryption disk modify`
. If the cluster is currently in a two-node switchless configuration, migrate the cluster to a two-node switched cluster using the type of switch you prefer.

. Send an AutoSupport message from each original node to inform technical support of the upgrade:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node <node_name> -type all -message "Upgrading node_name from <platform_original> to <platform_new>"`
