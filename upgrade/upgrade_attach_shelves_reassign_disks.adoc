You must reassign the disks that belonged to node1 and node2 to node3 and node4 respectively.

.About this task

You perform the steps in this section on node3 and node4, completing each step on node3 and then node4 before going on to the next step.

.Steps
. Connect the storage shelf cables from node1/node2 to node3/node4. Verify the power supply and physical connectivity of the shelves.
. From the node3 LOADER prompt, boot to Maintenance mode:
+
`boot_ontap maint`
. Display the system ID of node3:
+
`disk show -v`
+
----
*> disk show -v
Local System ID: 101268854
...
----
+
Record the system ID of node3 for use in Step 4 below.

. Reassign node1's spare disks, disks belonging to the root aggregate, and any data aggregates:
+
`disk reassign -s _node1_sysid_ -d _node3_sysid_ -p <node2_sysID>`
+
--
** The parameter `_node1_sysid_` is the value you recorded in  link:upgrade-shutdown-remove-original-nodes.html#shutdown_node_step5[Shutting down the original nodes, Step 5].
** Specify the parameter `_-p partner_sysID_` only when shared disks are present.

[NOTE]
====
When reassigning node2's spare disks, disks belonging to the root aggregate, and any data aggregates, the command is:

`disk reassign -s node2_sysid -d node4_sysid -p node3_sysID`

The system displays a message similar to the following:
+
----
Partner node must not be in Takeover mode during disk reassignment from maintenance mode.
Serious problems could result!!
Do not proceed with reassignment if the partner is in takeover mode. Abort reassignment (y/n)?n

After the node becomes operational, you must perform a takeover and giveback of the HA partner node to ensure disk reassignment is successful.
Do you want to continue (y/n)?y
----
. Enter `y` to continue.
+
The system displays a message similar to the following:
+
----
The system displays the following message:
Disk ownership will be updated on all disks previously belonging to Filer with sysid
<sysid>.
Do you want to continue (y/n)? y
----

. Enter `y` to continue.
. Ensure that node1's root aggregate is set to `root` in the options field and that other aggregates are online:
+
`aggr status`
+
You should see output similar to the following:
+
----
*> aggr status
           Aggr State           Status                Options
          aggr0 online          raid_dp, aggr         root
                                64-bit
----

. Exit Maintenance mode:
+
`halt`
