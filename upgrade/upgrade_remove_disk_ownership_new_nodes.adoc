If the new nodes have internal disks or add-on shelves attached to the system, these can interfere with the controller upgrade. Use the following steps to remove ownership of any new disks that came with node3/node4.

.About this task
These steps are performed on node3 and node4 one after the other. The node sequence does not matter.

[NOTE]
====
* The shelves from node1 and node2 are not physically connected to node3 and node4 at this stage.
* You are only required to remove disk ownership for disks and shelves that have come with new controllers.
* You are not required to remove ownership of disks if you are upgrading the hardware by swapping an old controller with a new controller on an internal drive platform while retaining the chassis and disks of the old controller.
+
For example, if you are upgrading your system from A200 to A220 by only swapping the old A200 controller module with the new A220 controller module while keeping the chassis and disks of the old A200 in place, you would not remove ownership of disks for the new A220 controller module as outlined in this section _Removing ownership of disks attached to the new nodes_.

Contact NetApp technical support if you have questions on removing disk ownership during a controller upgrade.

The following is a list of systems that have internal storage: FAS2220, FAS2240-2, FAS2240-4, FAS2520, FAS2552, FAS2554, FAS2620, FAS2650, FAS2720, FAS2750, AFF A200, AFF A220, AFF A700s, AFF A800, AFF A250.

If your system is not listed above, see the https://hwu.netapp.com[NetApp Hardware Universe] to check if it has internal drives.

.Steps
. At the LOADER prompt of the node, enter the command:
+
`boot_ontap menu`
. At the boot menu prompt, enter `9a` and then press Enter.
+
The following screen shows the boot menu prompt.

Please choose one of the following:

    (1) Normal Boot.
    (2) Boot without /etc/rc.
    (3) Change password.
    (4) Clean configuration and initialize all disks.
    (5) Maintenance mode boot.
    (6) Update flash from backup config.
    (7) Install new software first.
    (8) Reboot node.
    (9) Configure Advanced Drive Partitioning.
    Selection (1-9)?  9a

########## WARNING ##########

This is a disruptive operation and will result in the
    loss of all filesystem data. Before proceeding further,
    make sure that:
    1) This option (9a) has been executed or will be executed
    on the HA partner node, prior to reinitializing either
    system in the HA-pair.
    2) The HA partner node is currently in a halted state or
    at the LOADER prompt.


    Do you still want to continue (yes/no)? yes

The system removes disk ownership and returns to the boot menu.

. At the boot menu, enter `5` to go to maintenance mode.
. In maintenance mode, run the `disk show` command.
+
No disks should be listed.

. Run the command: `
+
`disk show -a`
+
All listed disks should be unassigned.

. Exit maintenance mode:
+
`halt`
