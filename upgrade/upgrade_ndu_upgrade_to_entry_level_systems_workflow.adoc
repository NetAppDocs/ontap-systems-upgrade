[.lead]
You can perform a nondisruptive upgrade from a NetApp AFF A250 system to an AFF A400 system without having to purchase additional storage and cluster switches. To perform the upgrade, you first prepare the AFF A250 nodes and set up the new AFF A400 nodes. You then reassign drives to the new nodes and migrate your data.

In this procedure, the AFF A250 high-availability (HA) pair controllers are called node1 and node2, and the replacement AFF A400 HA pair controllers are called node3 and node4.
