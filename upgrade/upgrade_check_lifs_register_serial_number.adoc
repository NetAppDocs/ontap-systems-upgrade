Before returning the replacement node to service, you should verify that the LIFs are on their home ports, and register the serial number of the replacement node if AutoSupport is enabled, and reset automatic giveback.

. Verify that the logical interfaces are reporting to their home server and ports: `network interface show -is-home false`
+
If any LIFs are listed as false, revert them to their home ports: `network interface revert *`

. Register the system serial number with NetApp Support.
