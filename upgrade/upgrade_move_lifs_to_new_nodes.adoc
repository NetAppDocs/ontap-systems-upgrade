After you have moved the volumes from the original nodes, you need to migrate the non-SAN data LIFs and cluster-management LIFs from the original nodes to the new nodes.

.About this task
You cannot migrate a LIF that is used for copy-offload operations with VMware vStorage APIs for Array Integration (VAAI).

.Steps
. From the node where the cluster LIF is hosted, change the home ports for the non-SAN data LIFs from the original nodes to the new nodes:
+
`network interface modify -vserver <vserver_name> -lif <lif_name> -home-node <new_node_name> -home-port {<netport|ifgrp>}`
. Take one of the following actions:

a|
A specific LIF
a|
`network interface migrate -vserver <vserver_name> -lif <lif_name> -source-node <source_node_name> -destination-node <dest_node_name> -destination-port <dest_port_name>`
a|
All the non-SAN data LIFs and cluster-management LIFs
a|
`network interface migrate-all -node <node_name>`
|===
The following command migrates a LIF named "datalif1" on the SVM "vs0" to the port "e0d" on "node0b":
+
----
cluster::> network interface migrate -vserver vs0 -lif datalif1 -destination-node node0b -destination-port e0d
----
+
The following command migrates all the data and cluster-management LIFs from the current (local) node:
+
----
cluster::> network interface migrate-all -node local
----

. Check whether the home node of the cluster-management LIF is on one of the original nodes: `network interface show -lif cluster_mgmt -fields home-node`
. If the home node of the cluster management LIF is on one of the original nodes, complete the following steps:
.. Switch the home node of the cluster-management LIF to one of the new nodes:
+
`network interface modify -vserver <cluster_name> -lif cluster_mgmt -home-node <new_node_name> -home-port {<netport|ifgrp>}`
.. Migrate the cluster-management LIF to one of the new nodes:
+
`network interface migrate -vserver <vserver_name> -lif cluster-mgmt -destination-node <new_node_name> -destination-port {<netport|ifgrp>}`
