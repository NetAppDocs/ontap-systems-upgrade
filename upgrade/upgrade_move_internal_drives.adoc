If your original node is one of the supported models, during the process of upgrading by moving storage you can move the node's internal SATA drives or SSDs to a drive shelf that is attached to the new node in the same cluster. You cannot transfer SAS drives to a drive shelf attached to the new nodes.

.Before you begin

* You must have reviewed link:upgrade_considerations.md#[Considerations for upgrading controller hardware] about moving internal drives.
+
You should contact technical support if you need guidance specific to your configuration.

* The SATA or SSD drive carriers from the original node must be compatible with the new drive shelf.
* A compatible drive shelf must already be attached to the new node.
* The drive shelf must have enough free bays to accommodate the SATA or SSD drive carriers from the original node.

.Steps
. Gently remove the bezel from the front of the system.
. [[move_int_drive_2]]Press the release button on the left side of the drive carrier.
+
The cam handle on the carrier partially springs open, and the carrier releases from the midplane.

. Pull the cam handle to its fully open position to unseat the carrier from the midplane, and then gently slide the carrier out of the drive shelf.
+
NOTE: Always use two hands when removing, installing, or carrying a drive. However, do not place your hands on the drive boards exposed on the underside of the carrier.

. With the cam handle in the open position, insert the carrier into a slot in the new drive shelf, firmly pushing until the carrier stops.
+
NOTE: Use two hands when inserting the carrier.

. [[move_int_drive_5]] Close the cam handle so that the carrier is fully seated in the midplane and the handle clicks into place.
+
You should close the handle slowly so that it aligns correctly with the face of the carrier.

. Repeat <<move_int_drive_2,Step 2>> through <<move_int_drive_5,Step 5>> for all of the drives that you are moving to the new system.
