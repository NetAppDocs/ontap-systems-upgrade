If you are using NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE) to encrypt volumes on the system you are upgrading, the encryption configuration must be synchronized to the new nodes. If key-manager is not restored, encrypted volumes will be taken offline when you relocate the node1 aggregates by using ARL from node2 to node3.
