During Stage 5, you install and boot node4, map the cluster and node-management ports from node2 to node4, and verify the node4 installation. If required, you set the FC or UTA/UTA2 configuration on node4 and confirm that node4 has joined quorum. You also relocate node2 NAS data LIFs and non-root aggregates from node3 to node4 and verify the SAN LIFs exist on node4.
