After you confirm that node3 is in quorum and can communicate with node2, you must re-create node1's VLANs, interface groups, and broadcast domains on node3. You must also add the node3 ports to the newly re-created broadcast domains.

.About this task

For more information on creating and re-creating VLANs, interface groups, and broadcast domains, go to link:other_references.html[References] and link to _Network Management_.

.Steps

. Re-create the VLANs on node3 using the node1 information recorded in the link:relocate_non_root_aggr_and_nas_data_lifs_node1_node2.html[Relocate non-root aggregates and NAS data LIFs owned by node1 to node2] section:
+
`network port vlan create -node _node_name_ -vlan _vlan-names_`

. Re-create the interface groups on node3 using the node1 information recorded in the link:relocate_non_root_aggr_and_nas_data_lifs_node1_node2.html[Relocate non-root aggregates and NAS data LIFs owned by node1 to node2] section:
+
`network port ifgrp create -node _node_name_ -ifgrp _port_ifgrp_names_-distr-func`

. Re-create the broadcast domains on node3 using the node1 information recorded in the link:relocate_non_root_aggr_and_nas_data_lifs_node1_node2.html[Relocate non-root aggregates and NAS data LIFs owned by node1 to node2] section:
+
`network port broadcast-domain create -ipspace Default -broadcast-domain _broadcast_domain_names_ -mtu _mtu_size_ -ports _node_name:port_name,node_name:port_name_`

. Add the node3 ports to the newly re-created broadcast domains:
+
`network port broadcast-domain add-ports -broadcast-domain _broadcast_domain_names_ -ports _node_name:port_name,node_name:port_name_`
