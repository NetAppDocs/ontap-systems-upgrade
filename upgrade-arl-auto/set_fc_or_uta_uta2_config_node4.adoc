summary: If node4 has onboard FC ports, UTA/UTA2 ports, or a UTA/UTA2 card, you must configure the settings before completing the rest of the procedure.

NOTE: If node4 does not have onboard FC ports, onboard UTA/UTA2 ports, or a UTA/UTA2 card, and you are upgrading a system with storage disks, you can skip to the link:map_ports_node2_node4.html[Map ports from node2 to node4] section.
However, if you have a V-Series system or have FlexArray Virtualization Software and are connected to storage arrays, and node4 does not have onboard FC ports, onboard UTA/ UTA2 ports, or a UTA/UTA2 card, you must return to the section _Install and boot node4_ and resume at link:install_boot_node4.html#step22[Step 22]. Make sure that node4 has sufficient rack space. If node4 is in a separate chassis from node2, you can put node4 in the same location as node3. If node2 and node4 are in the same chassis, then node4 is already in its appropriate rack location.

. If the system goes into a reboot loop with the message `no disks found`, this is because it has reset the ports back to the target mode and therefore is unable to see any disks. Continue with <<auto_check_4_step17,Step 17>> through <<auto_check_4_step22,Step 22>> to resolve this.

[start=23]
. [[auto_check_4_step23]]If you are upgrading from a system with external disks to a system that supports internal and external disks (AFF A800 systems, for example), set the node2 aggregate as the root aggregate to ensure node4 boots from the root aggregate of node2. To set the root aggregate, go to the boot menu and select option `5` to enter maintenance mode.
+
WARNING: *You must perform the following substeps in the exact order shown; failure to do so might cause an outage or even data loss.*

+
The following procedure sets node4 to boot from the root aggregate of node2:

.. Enter maintenance mode:
+
`boot_ontap maint`

.. Check the RAID, plex, and checksum information for the node2 aggregate:
+
`aggr status -r`

.. Check the status of the node2 aggregate:
+
`aggr status`

.. If necessary, bring the node2 aggregate online:
+
`aggr_online root_aggr_from_<node2>`

.. Prevent the node4 from booting from its original root aggregate:
+
`aggr offline <root_aggr_on_node4>`

.. Set the node2 root aggregate as the new root aggregate for node4:
+
`aggr options aggr_from_<node2> root`
