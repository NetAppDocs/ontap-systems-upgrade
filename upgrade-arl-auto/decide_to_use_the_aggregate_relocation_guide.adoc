There are several aggregate relocation (ARL) methods for upgrading controller hardware. This procedure describes how to upgrade the controller hardware using ARL with "system controller replace commands" on systems running ONTAP 9.7, 9.6, or 9.5. You should only use this complex procedure if you're an experienced ONTAP administrator. 

To help you decide if this ARL procedure is suitable for your controller hardware upgrade, you should review all of the following circumstances for supported upgrades:

* You are upgrading NetApp controllers running ONTAP 9.5, 9.6 or 9.7. This document is not applicable to upgrades to ONTAP 9.8.

* You don't want to add the new controllers as a new HA pair to the cluster and migrate the data using volume moves.

* You are experienced in administering ONTAP and are comfortable with the risks of working in the diagnostic privilege mode.

* Your hardware upgrade combination is listed in the <<sys_commands_95_97_supported_systems,supported model matrix>>.

* If you are upgrading a MetroCluster configuration, it is a 4-node or higher FC configuration, and all nodes are running ONTAP 9.6 or 9.7.

[NOTE]
====
* If you're upgrading a system by swapping controller modules in the same chassis, such as AFF A800 or AFF C800, NetApp strongly recommends using the upgrade procedure that link:../upgrade-arl-auto-affa900/index.html[upgrades controller models using ARL, keeping the existing system chassis and disks]. This ARL procedure includes the steps that ensure the internal disks remain secure in the chassis when you remove and install the controllers during the upgrade procedure.

* You can use NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE), NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE), and NetApp Aggregate Encryption (NAE) with this procedure.

NOTE: If your controller upgrade model combination is not in the above table, contact technical support.

^1^ARL automated upgrade for the AFF A700 system is supported from ONTAP 9.7P2.

^2^If you are updating to an AFF A800 or a system that supports internal and external disks, you must follow specific instructions for the root aggregate on internal NVMe disks. Refer to link:reassign-node1-disks-to-node3.html#auto_check3_step9[Reassign node1 disks to node3, Step 9] and link:reassign-node2-disks-to-node4.html#auto_check_4_step9[Reassign node2 disks to node4, Step 9].

^3^ARL automated upgrade from an AFF A300 to an AFF A800 system is supported from ONTAP 9.7P5.

^4^ARL automated upgrade from an AFF A300 to an AFF A400 and an FAS8200 to an FAS8300 system is supported from ONTAP 9.7P8.

^5^If you are upgrading from an AFF A300 to an AFF A400 or an FAS8200 to an FAS8300 system in a two-node switchless cluster configuration, you must pick temporary cluster ports for the controller upgrade. The AFF A400 and FAS8300 systems come in two configurations, as an Ethernet bundle where the mezzanine card ports are Ethernet type and as an FC bundle where the mezzanine ports are FC type.

* For an AFF A400 or an FAS8300 with an Ethernet type configuration, you can use any of the two mezzanine ports as temporary cluster ports.
* For an AFF A400 or an FAS8300 with an FC type configuration, you must add a four-port 10GbE network interface card (part number X1147A) to provide temporary cluster ports.
* After you complete a controller upgrade by using temporary cluster ports, you can nondisruptively migrate cluster LIFs to e3a and e3b, 100GbE ports on an AFF A400 system, and e0c and e0d, 100GbE ports on an FAS8300 system.
