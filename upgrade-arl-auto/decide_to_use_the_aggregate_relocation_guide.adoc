This guide describes how to upgrade the storage controllers in an HA pair with new controllers while keeping all the existing data and disks. This is a complex procedure that should be used only by experienced administrators.

You should use this guide under the following circumstances:

* You are upgrading NetApp controllers running ONTAP 9.5, 9.6 or 9.7. This document is not applicable to upgrades to ONTAP 9.8.

* You do not want to add the new controllers as a new HA pair to the cluster and migrate the data using volume moves.

* You are experienced in administering ONTAP and are comfortable with the risks of working in the diagnostic privilege mode.

* If you are upgrading a MetroCluster configuration, it is a 4-node or higher FC configuration, and all nodes are running ONTAP 9.6 or 9.7.

NOTE: You can use NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE) and NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE) with this procedure.

The following tables shows the supported model matrix for the controller upgrade.

[cols="50,50"]
|===
|Old controller |Replacement controller

|FAS8020, FAS8040, FAS8060, FAS8080
|FAS8200, FAS8300, FAS8700, FAS9000
|AFF8020, AFF8040, AFF8060, AFF8080
|AFF A300, AFF A400, AFF A700*, AFF A800**
|FAS8200
|FAS8700, FAS9000, FAS8300\****
|AFF A300
|AFF A700*, AFF A800\\***, AFF A400\****
|===

NOTE: If your controller upgrade model combination is not in the above table, contact technical support.

*ARL automated upgrade for the AFF A700 platform is supported from ONTAP 9.7P2.

**If you are updating to an AFF A800 or a system that supports internal and external disks, you must follow specific instructions for the root aggregate on internal NVMe disks. See link:set_fc_or_uta_uta2_config_on_node3.html#step14[Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node3, Step 14] and link:set_fc_or_uta_uta2_config_node4.html#step14[Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node4, Step 14].

***ARL automated upgrade from an AFF A300 to an AFF A800 platform is supported from ONTAP 9.7P5.

\****ARL automated upgrade from an AFF A300 to an AFF A400 and an FAS8200 to an FAS8300 platform is supported from ONTAP 9.7P8.
