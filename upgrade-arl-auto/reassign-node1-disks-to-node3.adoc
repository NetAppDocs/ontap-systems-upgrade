= Reassign node1 disks to node3

[.lead]
You need to reassign the disks that belonged to node1 to node3 before verifying the node3 installation.

.Steps

. [[reassign-node1-node3-step1]]Verify that node1 has stopped at the boot menu and reassign the disks of node1 to node3:
+
`boot_after_controller_replacement`
+
After a short delay, you are prompted to enter the name of the node that is being replaced. If there are shared disks (also called Advanced Disk Partitioning (ADP) or partitioned disks), you are prompted to enter the node name of the HA partner.
+
These prompts might get buried in the console messages. If you do not enter a node name or enter an incorrect name, you are prompted to enter the name again.

. If the system goes into a reboot loop with the message `no disks found`, this is because it has reset the ports back to the target mode and therefore is unable to see any disks. Perform <<auto_check3_step3,Step 3>> to <<auto_check3_step8,Step 8>> on node3 to resolve this issue.

. [[auto_check3_step3]]Press Ctrl-C during AUTOBOOT to stop the node at the LOADER> prompt.

. [[step18]]At the LOADER prompt, enter maintenance mode:
+
`boot_ontap maint`

. [[step19]]In maintenance mode, display all the previously set initiator ports that are now in target mode:
+
`ucadmin show`
+
Change the ports back to initiator mode:
+
`ucadmin modify -m fc -t initiator -f _adapter name_`

. [[step20]]Verify that the ports have been changed to initiator mode:
+
`ucadmin show`

. [[step21]]Exit maintenance mode:
+
`halt`
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are upgrading from a system that supports external disks to a system that also supports external disks, go to <<auto_check3_step8,Step 8>>.

If you are upgrading from a system that supports external disks to a system that supports both internal and external disks, for example, an AFF A800 system, go to <<auto_check3_step9,Step 9>>.
====
// GitHub issue #32
. [[auto_check3_step8]]At the LOADER prompt, boot up:
+
`boot_ontap menu`
+
Now, on booting, the node can detect all the disks that were previously assigned to it and can boot up as expected.
+
When the cluster nodes you are replacing use root volume encryption, ONTAP is unable to read the volume information from the disks. Restore the keys for the root volume:
+
.. Return to the special boot menu:
+
`LOADER> boot_ontap menu`
+

Please choose one of the following:
(1) Normal Boot.
(2) Boot without /etc/rc.
(3) Change password.
(4) Clean configuration and initialize all disks.
(5) Maintenance mode boot.
(6) Update flash from backup config.
(7) Install new software first.
(8) Reboot node.
(9) Configure Advanced Drive Partitioning.
(10) Set Onboard Key Manager recovery secrets.
(11) Configure node for external key management.

Selection (1-11)? 10
----
+
.. Select *(10) Set Onboard Key Manager recovery secrets*
+
.. Enter `y` at the following prompt:
+
`This option must be used only in disaster recovery procedures. Are you sure? (y or n): y`

+
.. At the prompt, enter the key-manager passphrase.
+
.. Enter the backup data when prompted.
+
NOTE: You must have obtained the passphrase and backup data in the link:prepare_nodes_for_upgrade.html[Prepare the nodes for upgrade] section of this procedure.
+
.. After the system boots to the special boot menu again, run option *(1) Normal Boot*
+ 
NOTE: You might encounter an error at this stage. If an error occurs, repeat the substeps in <<auto_check3_step8,Step 8>> until the system boots normally. 

. [[auto_check3_step9]]If you are upgrading from a system with external disks to a system that supports internal and external disks (AFF A800 systems, for example), set the node1 aggregate as the root aggregate to confirm that node3 boots from the root aggregate of node1. To set the root aggregate, go to the boot menu on node3 and select option `5` to enter maintenance mode.
+
CAUTION: *You must perform the following substeps in the exact order shown; failure to do so might cause an outage or even data loss.*
+

The following procedure sets node3 to boot from the root aggregate of node1:

.. Enter maintenance mode:
+
`boot_ontap maint`

.. Check the RAID, plex, and checksum information for the node1 aggregate:
+
`aggr status -r`

.. Check the status of the node1 aggregate:
+
`aggr status`

.. If necessary, bring the node1 aggregate online:
+
`aggr_online root_aggr_from___node1__`

.. Prevent the node3 from booting from its original root aggregate:
+
`aggr offline _root_aggr_on_node3_`

.. Set the node1 root aggregate as the new root aggregate for node3:
+
`aggr options aggr_from___node1__ root`

.. Verify that the root aggregate of node3 is offline and the root aggregate for the disks brought over from node1 is online and set to root:
+
`aggr status`
+
NOTE: Failing to perform the previous substep might cause node3 to boot from the internal root aggregate, or it might cause the system to assume a new cluster configuration exists or prompt you to identify one.
+
The following shows an example of the command output:
