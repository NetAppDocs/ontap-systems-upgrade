During a controller upgrade, the controller is replaced with another controller running a newer or more powerful platform.

Earlier versions of this content contained instructions for a nondisruptive controller update process that was comprised of entirely manual steps. This content provides the steps for the new automated procedure.

The manual process was lengthy and complex but in this simplified procedure you can implement a controller update using aggregate relocation, which enables more efficient nondisruptive upgrades for HA pairs. There are significantly fewer manual steps, especially around validation, collection of information, and post checks.
