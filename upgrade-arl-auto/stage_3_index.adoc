During Stage 3, you install and boot node3, map the cluster and node-management ports from node1 to node3, and verify the node3 installation. If required, you set the FC or UTA/UTA2 configuration on node3 and confirm that node3 has joined quorum. You also relocate the node1 NAS data LIFs and non-root aggregates from node2 to node3 and verify that the SAN LIFs exist on node3.
