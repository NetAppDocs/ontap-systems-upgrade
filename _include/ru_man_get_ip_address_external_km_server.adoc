After upgrading, you must immediately configure Storage Encryption and establish a cluster-wide authentication key to replace the previous node-level authentication keys.

.Steps

. Install the necessary client and server secure sockets layer (SSL) certificates required to communicate with key management servers:
+
`security certificate install`

. Configure Storage Encryption on all nodes by using the following command on each node:
+
`security key-manager setup`

. Add the IP address for each key management server:
+
`security key-manager add`

. Verify that the same key management servers are configured and available on all nodes in the cluster:
+
`security key-manager show -status`

. Create a new cluster-wide authentication key:
+
`security key-manager create-key`

. Make a note of the new authentication key ID.
. Rekey all self-encrypting drives with the new authentication key:
+
`storage encryption disk modify -disk * -data-key-id <authentication_key_id>`
