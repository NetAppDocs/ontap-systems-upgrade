Before you upgrade the nodes using ARL, you should understand how the procedure works. In this content, the procedure is broken down into several stages.

== Upgrade the node pair

To upgrade the node pair, you need to prepare the original nodes and then perform a series of steps on both the original and new nodes. You can then decommission the original nodes.

== ARL upgrade sequence overview

During the procedure, you upgrade the original controller hardware with the replacement controller hardware, one controller at a time, taking advantage of the HA pair configuration to relocate the ownership of non-root aggregates. All non-root aggregates must undergo two relocations to reach their final destination, which is the correct upgraded node.

Each aggregate has a home owner and current owner. The home owner is the actual owner of the aggregate, and the current owner is the temporary owner.

The following table describes the high-level tasks you perform during each stage and the state of aggregate ownership at the end of the stage.  Detailed steps are provided later in the procedure:
