Before you upgrade the nodes using ARL, you should understand how the procedure works. In this document, the procedure is broken down into several stages.

During the procedure, you upgrade the original controller hardware with the replacement controller hardware, one controller at a time, taking advantage of the HA pair configuration to relocate the ownership of non-root aggregates.

Each aggregate has a home owner and current owner. The home owner is the actual owner of the aggregate, and the current owner is the temporary owner.

The following table describes the high-level tasks you perform during each stage and the state of aggregate ownership at the end of the stage.  Detailed steps are provided later in the procedure:
