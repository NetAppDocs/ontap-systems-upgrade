[NOTE]
====
If you are upgrading from a system that supports external disks to a system that also supports external disks, go to <<auto_check_4_step22,Step 22>>.

If you are upgrading from a system that uses external disks to a system that supports both internal and external disks, for example, an AFF A800 system, go to <<auto_check_4_step23,Step 23>>.

. [[auto_check_4_step22]]At the loader prompt, boot up:
+
`boot_ontap menu`
+
Now, on booting, the node can detect all the disks that were previously assigned to it and can boot up as expected.
+
When the cluster nodes you are replacing use root volume encryption, ONTAP software is unable to read the volume information from the disks. To restore the keys for the root volume:
+
.. Return to the special boot menu:
`LOADER> boot_ontap menu`
