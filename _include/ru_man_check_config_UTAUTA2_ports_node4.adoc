== Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node4

If node4 has onboard UTA/UTA2 ports or a UTA/UTA2A card, you must check the configuration of the ports and configure them, depending on how you want to use the upgraded system.

.Before you begin

You must have the correct SFP+ modules for the UTA/UTA2 ports.

.About this task

UTA/UTA2 ports can be configured into native FC mode or UTA/UTA2A mode. FC mode supports FC initiator and FC target; UTA/UTA2 mode allows concurrent NIC and FCoE traffic to share the same 10 GbE SFP+ interface and supports FC target.

NOTE: NetApp marketing materials might use the term UTA2 to refer to CNA adapters and ports. However, the CLI uses the term CNA.

UTA/UTA2 ports might be on an adapter or on the controller with the following configurations:

* UTA/UTA2 cards ordered at the same time as the controller are configured before shipment to have the personality you requested.
* UTA/UTA2 cards ordered separately from the controller are shipped with the default FC target personality.
* Onboard UTA/UTA2 ports on new controllers are configured (before shipment) to have the personality you requested.

However, you should check the configuration of the UTA/UTA2 ports on node4 and change it, if necessary.

*Attention*: If your system has storage disks, you enter the commands in this section at the cluster prompt unless directed to enter Maintenance mode. If you have a MetroCluster FC system, V-Series system or a system with FlexArray Virtualization software that is connected to storage arrays,  you must be in Maintenance mode to configure UTA/UTA2 ports.

.Steps

. Check how the ports are currently configured by using one of the following commands on node4:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="35,65"]
|===
|If the system... |Thenâ€¦
|Has storage disks
|`system node hardware unified-connect show`
|Is a V-Series system or has FlexArray Virtualization Software and is connected to storage arrays
|`ucadmin show`
|===
+
The system displays output similar to the following example:
+
....
*> ucadmin show
                Current  Current    Pending   Pending   Admin
Node   Adapter  Mode     Type       Mode      Type      Status
----   -------  ---      ---------  -------   --------  -------
f-a    0e       fc       initiator  -          -        online
f-a    0f       fc       initiator  -          -        online
f-a    0g       cna      target     -          -        online
f-a    0h       cna      target     -          -        online
f-a    0e       fc       initiator  -          -        online
f-a    0f       fc       initiator  -          -        online
f-a    0g       cna      target     -          -        online
f-a    0h       cna      target     -          -        online
*>
....

. If the current SFP+ module does not match the desired use, replace it with the correct SFP+ module.
+
Contact your NetApp representative to obtain the correct SFP+ module.

. Examine the output of the `system node hardware unified-connect show` or `ucadmin show` command and determine whether the UTA/UTA2 ports have the personality you want.

. Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="35,65"]
|===
|If the CNA ports... |Then...
|Do not have the personality that you want
|Go to <<man_check_4_Step5,Step 5>>.
|Have the personality that you want
|Skip Step 5 through Step 12 and go to <<man_check_4_Step13,Step 13>>.
|===

. [[man_check_4_Step5]]Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="35,65"]
|===
|If the system... |Then...

|Has storage disks and is running Data ONTAP 8.3
|Boot node4 and enter maintenance mode:

`boot_ontap maint`
|Is a V-Series system or has FlexArray Virtualization Software and is connected to storage arrays
|Go to <<man_check_4_Step6,Step 6>>.
You should already be in Maintenance mode.
|===

. [[man_check_4_Step6]]Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="35,65"]
|===
|If you are configuring... |Then...
|Ports on a UTA/UTA2A card
|Go to <<man_check_4_Step7,Step 7>>.
|Onboard UTA/UTA2 ports
|Skip Step 7 and go to <<man_check_4_Step8,Step 8>>.
|===

. [[man_check_4_Step7]]If the adapter is in initiator mode, and if the UTA/UTA2 port is online, take the UTA/UTA2 port offline:
+
`storage disable adapter <adapter_name>`
+
Adapters in target mode are automatically offline in Maintenance mode.

. [[man_check_4_Step8]]If the current configuration does not match the desired use, enter the following command to change the configuration as needed:
+
`ucadmin modify -m fc|cna -t initiator|target <adapter_name>`
+
* `-m` is the personality mode: FC or 10GbE UTA.
* `-t` is the FC4 type: target or initiator.

+
NOTE: You need to use FC initiator for tape drives and FlexArray Virtualization systems. You need to use the FC target for SAN clients.

. Verify the settings by entering the following command and examining its output:
+
`ucadmin show`

. Perform one of the following actions:
+
[cols=2*, options="header",cols="35,65"]
|===
|If the system... |Then...

|Has storage disks
a|.. Enter the following command:
+
`halt`
+
The system stops at the boot environment prompt.
.. Enter the following command:
+
`boot_ontap`
|Is a V-Series system or has FlexArray Virtualization Software and is connected to storage arrays and is running Data ONTAP 8.3
|Reboot to Maintenance mode:

`boot_ontap maint`
|===

. Verify the settings:
+
[cols=2*, options="header",cols="35,65"]
|===
|If the system... |Then...

|Has storage disks
|Enter the following command:

`system node hardware unified-connect show`
|Is a V-Series system or has FlexArray Virtualization Software and is connected to storage arrays
|Enter the following command:

`ucadmin show`
|===
+
The output in the following examples shows that the FC4 type of adapter "1b" is changing to `initiator` and that the mode of adapters "2a" and "2b" is changing to `cna`.
