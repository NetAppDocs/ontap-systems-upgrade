== Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node4

If node4 has onboard UTA/UTA2 ports or a UTA/UTA2A card, you must check the configuration of the ports and configure them, depending on how you want to use the upgraded system.

.Before you begin

You must have the correct SFP+ modules for the UTA/UTA2 ports.

.About this task

UTA/UTA2 ports can be configured into native FC mode or UTA/UTA2A mode. FC mode supports FC initiator and FC target; UTA/UTA2 mode enables concurrent NIC and FCoE traffic to share the same 10GbE SFP+ interface and supports FC target.

NOTE: NetApp marketing materials might use the term UTA2 to refer to CNA adapters and ports. However, the CLI uses the term CNA.

UTA/UTA2 ports might be on an adapter or on the controller with the following configurations:

* UTA/UTA2 cards ordered at the same time as the controller are configured before shipment to have the personality you requested.
* UTA/UTA2 cards ordered separately from the controller are shipped with the default FC target personality.
* Onboard UTA/UTA2 ports on new controllers are configured (before shipment) to have the personality you requested.

However, you can check the configuration of the UTA/UTA2 ports on node4 and change it, if necessary.

WARNING: Enter the commands in this section at the cluster prompt unless directed to enter Maintenance mode. If you have a MetroCluster FC system, you must be in Maintenance mode to configure UTA/UTA2 ports.

.Steps

. Check how the ports are currently configured on node4:
+
`system node hardware unified-connect show`

. If the current SFP+ module does not match the desired use, replace it with the correct SFP+ module.
+
Contact your NetApp representative to obtain the correct SFP+ module.

. Examine the output of the `system node hardware unified-connect show` or `ucadmin show` command and determine whether the UTA/UTA2 ports have the personality you want.

. Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="35,65"]
|===
|If the CNA ports... |Then...
|Do not have the personality that you want
|Go to <<man_check_4_Step5,Step 5>>.
|Have the personality that you want
|Skip Step 5 through Step 12 and go to <<man_check_4_Step13,Step 13>>.
|===

. [[man_check_4_Step5]]If the system has storage disks and is running Data ONTAP 8.3, boot node4 and enter maintenance mode:
+
`boot_ontap maint`

. Verify the settings by entering the following command and examining its output:
+
`ucadmin show`

. Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="35,65"]
|===
|If you are configuring... |Then...
|Ports on a UTA/UTA2A card
|Go to <<man_check_4_Step8,Step 8>>.
|Onboard UTA/UTA2 ports
|Skip Step 8 and go to <<man_check_4_Step9,Step 9>>.
|===

. [[man_check_4_Step8]]If the adapter is in initiator mode, and if the UTA/UTA2 port is online, take the UTA/UTA2 port offline:
+
`storage disable adapter _adapter_name_`
+
Adapters in target mode are automatically offline in Maintenance mode.

. [[man_check_4_Step9]]If the current configuration does not match the desired use, enter the following command to change the configuration as needed:
+
`ucadmin modify -m fc|cna -t initiator|target _adapter_name_`
+
* `-m` is the personality mode: FC or 10GbE UTA.
* `-t` is the FC4 type: target or initiator.

+
NOTE: You must use FC initiator for tape drives and the FC target for SAN clients.


. If the system as storage disks, enter the following command:
+
`halt`
+
The system stops at the boot environment prompt.

.. Enter the following command:
+
`boot_ontap`

. If the system has storage disks, enter the following command:
+
`system node hardware unified-connect show`
+
The output in the following examples shows that the FC4 type of adapter "1b" is changing to `initiator` and that the mode of adapters "2a" and "2b" is changing to `cna`.

. Place any target ports online by entering one of the following commands, once for each port:
+
`network fcp adapter modify -node _node_name_ -adapter _adapter_name_ -state up`

. [[man_check_4_Step13]]Cable the port.
