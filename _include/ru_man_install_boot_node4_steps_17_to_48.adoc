`ifconfig e0M -addr=_filer_addr_ mask=_netmask_ -gw=_gateway_ dns=_dns_addr_ domain=_dns_domain_`

`_filer_addr_` is the IP address of the storage system (mandatory). 
`_netmask_` is the network mask of the storage system (mandatory).
`_gateway_` is the gateway for the storage system (mandatory).
`_dns_addr_` is the IP address of a name server on your network (optional).
`_dns_domain_` is the Domain Name Service (DNS) domain name. If you use this optional parameter, you do not need a fully qualified domain name in the netboot server URL; you need only the server's host name.

NOTE: Other parameters might be necessary for your interface. Enter `help ifconfig` at the firmware prompt for details.

|FAS/AFF8000 series systems |`netboot \http://<web_server_ip/path_to_webaccessible_directory>/netboot/kernel`
|All other systems |`netboot \http://<web_server_ip/path_to_webaccessible_directory/ontap_version>_image.tgz`
|===
The `<path_to_the_web-accessible_directory>` should lead to where you downloaded the
`<ontap_version>_image.tgz` in link:prepare_for_netboot.html#man_netboot_Step1[Step 1] in the section _Prepare for netboot_.
+
NOTE: Do not interrupt the boot.

. From the boot menu, select `option (7) Install new software first`.
+
This menu option downloads and installs the new Data ONTAP image to the boot device.
+
Disregard the following message:
+
`This procedure is not supported for Non-Disruptive Upgrade on an HA pair`
+
The note applies to nondisruptive upgrades of Data ONTAP, and not upgrades of controllers.
+
NOTE: Always use netboot to update the new node to the desired image. If you use another method to install the image on the new controller, the incorrect image might install. This issue applies to all releases of ONTAP. The netboot procedure combined with option `(7) Install new software` wipes the boot media and places the same ONTAP version on both image partitions.

. [[man_install4_step23]] If you are prompted to continue the procedure, enter y, and when prompted for the package, enter the URL:
+
`\http://<web_server_ip/path_to_web-accessible_directory/ontap_version>_image.tgz`

. Complete the following substeps:
.. Enter `n` to skip the backup recovery when you see the following prompt:
+
----
Do you want to restore the backup configuration now? {y|n}
----

.. Reboot by entering `y` when you see the following prompt:
+
----
The node must be rebooted to start using the newly installed software. Do you want to reboot now? {y|n}
----
+
The controller module reboots but stops at the boot menu because the boot device was reformatted and the configuration data needs to be restored.

. [[man_install4_Step25]]Select maintenance mode `5` from the boot menu and enter `y` when you are prompted to continue with the boot.

. [[man_install4_Step26]]Before continuing, go to link:set_fc_uta_uta2_config_node4.html[Set the FC or UTA/UTA2 configuration on node4] to make any necessary changes to the FC or UTA/UTA2 ports on the node. Make the changes recommended in those sections, reboot the node, and go into Maintenance mode.

. Enter the following command and examine the output to find the system ID of node4:
+
`disk show -a`
+
The system displays the system ID of the node and information about its disks, as shown in the following example:
+
----

. Reassign node2's spares, disks belonging to the root, and any non-root aggregates that were not relocated to node3 earlier in section link:relocate_non_root_aggr_node2_node3.html[Relocate non-root aggregates from node2 to node3]:
+
NOTE: If you have shared disks, hybrid aggregates, or both on your system, you must use the correct `disk reassign` command from the following table.
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="35,65"]
|===
|Disk type... |Run the command...
|With shared disks |`disk reassign -s`

`_node2_sysid_ -d _node4_sysid_ -p _node3_sysid_`
|Without shared |`disks disk reassign -s`

`_node2_sysid_ -d _node4_sysid_`
|===
+
For the `<node2_sysid>` value, use the information captured in link:record_node2_information.html#man_node2_info_step10[Step 10] of the _Record node2 information_ section. For `_node4_sysid_`, use the information captured in <<man_install4_step23,Step 23>>.
+
NOTE: The `-p` option is only required in maintenance mode when shared disks are present.

+
The `disk reassign` command will reassign only those disks for which `_node2_sysid_` is the current owner.
+
The system displays the following message:
+
----
Partner node must not be in Takeover mode during disk reassignment from maintenance mode.
Serious problems could result!!
Do not proceed with reassignment if the partner is in takeover mode. Abort reassignment (y/n)? n
----
Enter `n` when asked to abort disk reassignment.
+
When you are asked to abort disk reassignment, you must answer a series of prompts as shown in the following steps:

.. The system displays the following message:
+
----
After the node becomes operational, you must perform a takeover and giveback of the HA partner node to ensure disk reassignment is successful.
Do you want to continue (y/n)? y
----
.. Enter `y` to continue.
+
The system displays the following message:
+
----
Disk ownership will be updated on all disks previously belonging to Filer with sysid <sysid>.
Do you want to continue (y/n)? y
----
.. Enter `y` to allow disk ownership to be updated.

. If you are upgrading from a system with external disks to a system that supports internal and external disks (A800 systems, for example), set node4 as root to confirm that it boots from the root aggregate of node2.
+
WARNING: *Warning: You must perform the following substeps in the exact order shown; failure to do so might cause an outage or even data loss.*

+
The following procedure sets node4 to boot from the root aggregate of node2:

.. Check the RAID, plex, and checksum information for the node2 aggregate:
+
`aggr status -r`
.. Check the overall status of the node2 aggregate:
+
`aggr status`
.. If necessary, bring the node2 aggregate online:
+
`aggr_online root_aggr_from___node2__`
.. Prevent the node4 from booting from its original root aggregate:
+
`aggr offline _root_aggr_on_node4_`
.. Set the node2 root aggregate as the new root aggregate for node4:
+
`aggr options aggr_from___node2__ root`

. Verify that the controller and chassis are configured as `ha` by entering the following command and observing the output:
+
`ha-config show`
+
The following example shows the output of the `ha-config show` command:
+
----
*> ha-config show
   Chassis HA configuration: ha
   Controller HA configuration: ha
----
Systems record in a PROM whether they are in an HA pair or a stand-alone configuration. The state must be the same on all components within the stand-alone system or HA pair.
+
If the controller and chassis are not configured as `ha`, use the following commands to correct the configuration:
+
`ha-config modify controller ha`
+
`ha-config modify chassis ha`.
+
If you have a MetroCluster configuration, use the following commands to correct the configuration:
+
`ha-config modify controller mcc`
+
`ha-config modify chassis mcc`.

. Destroy the mailboxes on node4:
+
`mailbox destroy local`

. Exit Maintenance mode:
+
`halt`
+
The system stops at the boot environment prompt.

. On node3, check the system date, time, and time zone:
+
`date`

. On node4, check the date at the boot environment prompt:
+
`show date`

. If necessary, set the date on node4:
+
`set date _mm/dd/yyyy_`

. On node4, check the time at the boot environment prompt:
+
`show time`

. If necessary, set the time on node4:
+
`set time _hh:mm:ss_`

. Verify the partner system ID is set correctly as noted in <<man_install4_Step26,Step 26>> under option.
+
`printenv partner-sysid`

. If necessary, set the partner system ID on node4:
+
`setenv partner-sysid _node3_sysid_`

.. Save the settings:
+
`saveenv`

. Enter the boot menu at the boot environment prompt:
+
`boot_ontap menu`

. At the boot menu, select option *(6) Update flash from backup config* by entering `6` at the prompt.
+
The system displays the following message:
+
----
This will replace all flash-based configuration with the last backup to disks. Are you sure you want to continue?:
----

. Enter `y` at the prompt.
+
The boot proceeds normally, and the system prompts you to confirm the system ID mismatch.
+
NOTE: The system might reboot twice before displaying the mismatch warning.

. Confirm the mismatch.
The node might complete one round of rebooting before booting normally.

. Log in to node4.
