. [[step1]]Make sure that you have rack space for node3.
+
If node1 and node2 were in separate chassis, you can put node3 in the same rack location as node1. However, if node1 was in the same chassis with node2, then you need to put node3 into its own rack space, preferably close to the location of node1.

. [[step2]]Install node3 in the rack, following the *Installation and Setup Instructions* for your node model.
+
NOTE: If you are upgrading to a system with both nodes in the same chassis, install node4 in the chassis as well as node3. If you do not, when you boot node3, the node will behave as if it were in a dual-chassis configuration, and when you boot node4, the interconnect between the nodes will not come up.

. [[step3]]Cable node3, moving the connections from node1 to node3.
+
Cable the following connections, using the *Installation and Setup Instructions* or the link:https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.vs-irrg/home.html[FlexArray Virtualization Installation Requirements and Reference] for the node3 platform, the appropriate disk shelf guide, and the link:https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-hacg/home.html[ONTAP 9 High-Availability Configuration Guide]:
+
* Console (remote management port)
* Cluster ports
* Data ports
* Cluster and node management ports
* Storage
* SAN configurations: iSCSI Ethernet and FC switch ports
+
NOTE: You might not need to move the interconnect card or the cluster interconnect cable connection from node1 to node3 because most platform models have a unique interconnect card model.
For the MetroCluster configuration, you need to move the FC-VI cable connections from node1 to node3. If the new host does not have an FC-VI card, you might need to move the FC-VI card.

. [[step4]]Turn on the power to node3, and then interrupt the boot process by pressing Ctrl-C at the console terminal to access the boot environment prompt.
+
If you are upgrading to a system with both nodes in the same chassis, node4 also reboots. However, you can disregard the node4 boot until later.
+
NOTE: When you boot node3, you might see the following warning message:
+
....
WARNING: The battery is unfit to retain data during a power outage. This is likely because the battery is discharged but could be due to other temporary conditions.
When the battery is ready, the boot process will complete and services will be engaged.
To override this delay, press 'c' followed by 'Enter'
....

. [[step5]]If you see the warning message in <<step4,Step 4>>, take the following actions:
.. Check for any console messages that might indicate a problem other than a low NVRAM battery, and, if necessary, take any required corrective action.
.. Allow the battery to charge and the boot process to complete.
