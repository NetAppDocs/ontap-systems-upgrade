== Correct aggregate ownership if an ARL precheck fails

If the Aggregate Status Check fails, you must return aggregates owned by the partner node to the home owner node and initiate the precheck process again.

.Steps

. Return the aggregates currently owned by the partner node to the home owner node:
+
`storage aggregate relocation start -node <source_node> -destination <destination-node> - aggregate-list *`

. Verify that neither node1 nor node2 still owns aggregates for which it is the current owner (but not the home owner):
+
`storage aggregate show -nodes <node_name> -is-home false -fields owner-name,home- name,state`
+
The following example shows the output of the command when a node is both the current owner and home owner of aggregates:
+
----
cluster::> storage aggregate show -nodes node1 -is-home true -fields owner-name,home-name,state
aggregate   home-name  owner-name  state
---------   ---------  ----------  ------
aggr1       node1      node1       online
aggr2       node1      node1       online
aggr3       node1      node1       online
aggr4       node1      node1       online

==== After you finish

You must restart the controller replacement process:

`system controller replace start -nodes <node_names>`
