During Stage 6, you confirm that the new nodes are set up correctly and, if the new nodes are encryption-enabled, you configure and set up Storage Encryption or NetApp Volume Encryption. You should also decommission the old nodes and resume the SnapMirror operations.

.For MetroCluster FC configuration

For MetroCluster FC configuration, you must replace the disaster recovery/failover site nodes as soon as possible. Mismatch in controller models within a MetroCluster is not supported because controller model mismatch can cause disaster recovery mirroring to go offline. Use the command -`skip-metrocluster-check true` option to bypass MetroCluster checks when you are replacing nodes at second site.
