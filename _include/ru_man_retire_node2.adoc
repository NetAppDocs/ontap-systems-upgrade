To retire node2, you need to shut node2 down properly and remove it from the rack or chassis. If the cluster is in a SAN environment, you also need to delete the SAN LIFs.

.Steps

. Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="35,65"]
|===
|If the cluster is... |Then...
|A two-node cluster
|Go to <<man_retire_2_Step2,Step 2>>.
|A cluster with more than two nodes
|Go to <<man_retire_2_Step9,Step 9>>.
|===

. [[man_retire_2_Step2]]Access the advanced privilege level by entering the following command on either node:
+
`set -privilege advanced`

. Verify that the cluster HA has been disabled by entering the following command and examining its output:
+
`cluster ha show`
+
The system displays the following message:
+
----
High Availability Configured: false
----

. Check if node2 currently holds epsilon by entering the following command and examining its output:
+
`cluster show`
+
The following example shows that node2 holds epsilon:
+
----
cluster*::> cluster show
Node                 Health  Eligibility   Epsilon
-------------------- ------- ------------  -----------
node1                true    true          false
node2                true    true          true

Warning: Cluster HA has not been configured. Cluster HA must be configured on a two-node cluster to ensure data access availability in the event of storage failover. Use the "cluster ha modify -configured true" command to configure cluster HA.

. If node2 holds epsilon, mark epsilon as `false` on the node so that it can be transferred to node3:
+
`cluster modify -node <node2> -epsilon false`

. Transfer epsilon to node3 by marking epsilon `true` on node3:
+
`cluster modify -node <node3> -epsilon true`

. Verify if the setup is a two-node switchless cluster:
+
`network options switchless-cluster show`
+
----
cluster::*> network options switchless-cluster show
Enable Switchless Cluster: false/true
----
+
The value of this command must match the physical state of the system.

. Verify if the setup is a two-node switchless cluster:
+
`network options switchless-cluster show`
+
----
cluster::*> network options switchless-cluster show
Enable Switchless Cluster: false/true
----
+
The value of this command must match the physical state of the system.

. [[man_retire_2_Step9]]Return to the admin level:
+
`set -privilege admin`

. Halt node2 by entering the following command on either controller:
`system node halt -node <node2>`

. After node2 shuts down completely, remove it from the chassis or the rack. You can decommission node2 after the upgrade is completed. See link:decommission_old_system.html[Decommission the old system].
