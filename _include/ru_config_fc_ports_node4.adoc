== Configure FC ports on node4

If node4 has FC ports, either onboard or on an FC adapter, you must set port configurations on the node before you bring it into service because the ports are not preconfigured. If the ports are not configured, you might experience a disruption in service.

.Before you begin

You must have the values of the FC port settings from node2 that you saved in the section link:prepare_nodes_for_upgrade.html[Prepare the nodes for upgrade].

.About this task

You can skip this section if your system does not have FC configurations. If your system has onboard UTA/UTA2 ports or a UTA/UTA2 adapter, you configure them in link:set_fc_or_uta_uta2_config_node4.html#check-and-configure-utauta2-ports-on-node4[Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node4].

*Important*: If your system has storage disks, you must enter the commands in this section at the cluster prompt. If you have a V-Series system or a system with FlexArray Virtualization Software connected to storage arrays, you enter commands in this section in Maintenance mode.

.Steps

. Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===
|If the system that you are upgrading... |Then…

|Has storage disks
|
`system node hardware unified-connect show`
|Is a V-Series system or has FlexArray Virtualization Software and is connected to storage arrays
|`ucadmin show`
|===
+
The system displays information about all FC and converged network adapters on the system.

. Compare the FC settings on node4 with the settings that you captured earlier from node1.

a|Modify the FC ports on node4 as needed:

* To program target ports:
+
`ucadmin modify -m fc -t target <adapter>`
* To program initiator ports:
+
`ucadmin modify -m fc -t initiator <adapter>`

`-t` is the FC4 type: target or initiator.
|Is a V-Series system or has FlexArray Virtualization Software and is connected to storage arrays

|Modify the FC ports on node4 as needed:

`ucadmin modify -m fc -t initiator -f <adapter_port_name>`

`-t` is the FC4 type, target or initiator.

*Note*: The FC ports must be programmed as initiators.

. Exit Maintenance mode:
+
`halt`

. Boot the system from loader prompt:
+
`boot_ontap menu`

. After you enter the command, wait until the system stops at the boot environment prompt.
. Select option `5` from the boot menu for maintenance mode.
