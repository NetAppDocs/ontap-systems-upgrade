. [[step24]]Add the FC initiator ports to the storage array as new hosts, mapping the array LUNs to the new hosts.
+
See your storage array and zoning documentation for instructions.

. [[step25]]Modify the worldwide port name (WWPN) values in the host or volume groups associated with array LUNs on the storage array.
+
Installing a new controller module changes the WWPN values associated with each onboard FC port.

. [[step26]]If your configuration uses switch-based zoning, adjust the zoning to reflect the new WWPN values.
. [[step27]]If NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE) is in use on this configuration, the `setenv bootarg.storageencryption.support` command must be set to `true`, and the `kmip.init.maxwait` variable needs to be set to `off` to avoid a boot loop after the node1 configuration is loaded:
+
`setenv bootarg.storageencryption.support true`
+
`setenv kmip.init.maxwait off`
