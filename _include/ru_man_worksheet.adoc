You must gather certain information to successfully upgrade the original nodes.  The information includes node IDs, port and LIF details, licensing keys, and IP addresses.

You can use the following worksheet to record information for use later in the procedure:

|===
|Information needed |When collected |When used |Collected Information

|Model, system ID, serial number of original nodes
|Stage 1: _Prepare the nodes for the upgrade_
|Stage 3: _Install and boot node3_

Stage 5: _Install and boot node4_

Stage 6: _Decommission the old system_
|
|Shelf and disk information, flash storage details, memory, NVRAM, and adapter cards on original nodes
|Stage 1: _Preparing the nodes for the upgrade_
|Throughout the procedure
|
|Online aggregates and volumes on original nodes
|Stage 1: _Prepare the nodes for the upgrade_
|Throughout the procedure to verify that aggregates and volumes remain online except during brief relocation
|
|Output of commands `network port vlan show` and `network port ifgrp show`
|Stage 1: _Prepare the nodes for the upgrade_
|Stage 3: _Map ports from node1 to node3_

Stage 5: _Map ports from node2 to node4_
|
|(SAN environments only) Default configuration of FC ports
|Stage 1: _Prepare the nodes for the upgrade_
|When configuring FC ports on the new nodes
|
|(V-Series systems or systems with FlexArray Virtualization software only)

|Stage 3: _Install and boot node3_

Stage 5: _Install and boot node4_
|
|IP address of SPs
|Stage 1: _Prepare the nodes for the upgrade_
|Stage 6: _Ensure that the new controllers are set up correctly_
|
|License keys
|Stage 1: _Prepare the nodes for the upgrade_
|Stage 6: _Ensure that the new controllers are set up correctly_
|
|IP address for the external key management server

|Stage 6: _Set up Storage Encryption on the new nodes_
|
|Name and path of web-accessible directory where you download files to netboot the nodes
|Stage 1: _Prepare to netboot_
|Stage 3: _Install  and boot node3_

Stage 5: _Install and boot node4_
|
|Non-SAN data LIFs owned by node1
|Stage 2: _Move nonSAN data LIFs owned by node1 to node2_
|Later in the section
|
|Cluster, intercluster, node-management, cluster-management, and physical ports
|Stage 2: _Record node1 information_
|Stage 3: _Install and boot node3_

Stage 3: _Map ports from node1 to node3_
|
|Ports on new nodes
