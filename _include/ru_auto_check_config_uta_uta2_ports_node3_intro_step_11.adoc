== Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node3

If node3 has onboard UTA/UTA2 ports or a UTA/UTA2 card, you must check the configuration of the ports and possibly reconfigure them, depending on how you want to use the upgraded system.

.Before you begin

You must have the correct SFP+ modules for the UTA/UTA2 ports.

.About this task

If you want to use a Unified Target Adapter (UTA/UTA2) port for FC, you must first verify how the port is configured.

NOTE: NetApp marketing materials might use the term UTA2 to refer to CNA adapters and ports. However, the CLI uses the term CNA.

You can use the `ucadmin show` command to view or verify the current port configuration, as shown in the following example output:

....
*> ucadmin show
         Current  Current    Pending   Pending      Admin
Adapter  Mode     Type       Mode      Type         Status
-------  -------  -------    --------  ----------   --------
0e      fc        target     -         initiator    offline
0f      fc        target     -         initiator    offline
0g      fc        target     -         initiator    offline
0h      fc        target     -         initiator    offline
1a      fc        target     -         -            online
1b      fc        target     -         -            online
6 entries were displayed.

UTA/UTA2 ports can be configured into native FC mode or UTA/UTA2 mode. FC mode supports FC initiator and FC target; UTA/UTA2 mode allows concurrent NIC and FCoE traffic sharing the same 10GbE SFP+ interface and supports FC targets.

UTA/UTA2 ports might be found on an add-on adapter or on the controller motherboard, and have the following configurations, but you should check the configuration of the UTA/UTA2 ports on the node3 and change it, if necessary:

* UTA/UTA2 cards ordered when the controller is ordered are configured before shipment to have the personality you request.
* UTA/UTA2 cards ordered separately from the controller are shipped with the default FC target personality.
* Onboard UTA/UTA2 ports on new controllers are configured before shipment to have the personality you request.

WARNING: You must be in Maintenance mode to configure UTA/UTA2 ports. Enter the commands in this section at the Maintenance mode shell prompt. 

.Steps

. If the current SFP+ module does not match the desired use, replace it with the correct SFP+ module.
+
Contact your NetApp representative to obtain the correct SFP+ module.

. Examine the output of the `ucadmin show` command and determine whether the UTA/UTA2 ports have the personality you want.

. Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===
|If the UTA/UTA2 ports... |Then…

|Do not have the personality that you want
|Go to <<auto_check3_step4,Step 4>>.

|Have the personality that you want
|Skip Step 4 through Step 9 and go to <<auto_check3_step10,Step 10>>.
|===

. [[auto_check3_step4]]Verify the settings:
+
`ucadmin show`
+
The output in the following example shows that the type of adapter "1b" is changing to `initiator` and that the mode of adapters "2a" and "2b" is changing to `cna`. CNA mode allows you to use the card as a network adapter.

*> ucadmin show
         Current    Current     Pending  Pending     Admin
Adapter  Mode       Type        Mode     Type        Status

1a       fc         initiator   -        -           online
1b       fc         target      -        initiator   online
2a       fc         target      cna      -           online
2b       fc         target      cna      -           online

|If you are configuring... |Then…

|Ports on a UTA/UTA2 card
|Go to <<auto_check3_step6,Step 6>>
|Onboard UTA/UTA2 ports
a|Skip Step 6 and go to <<auto_check3_step7,Step 7>>.
|===

. [[auto_check3_step6]]If the adapter is in initiator mode, and if the UTA/UTA2 port is online, take the UTA/UTA2 port offline:
+
`storage disable adapter <adapter_name>`
+
Adapters in target mode are automatically offline in Maintenance mode.

. [[auto_check3_step6]]If the current configuration does not match the desired use, change the configuration as needed:
+
`ucadmin modify -m fc|cna -t initiator|target <adapter_name>`
+
** `-m` is the personality mode, `fc` or `cna`.
** `-t` is the FC4 type, `target` or `initiator`.
+
NOTE: You must use FC initiator for tape drives and MetroCluster configurations. You must use the FC target for SAN clients.



. Place any target ports online by entering the following command once for each port:
+
`storage enable adapter <adapter_name>`

. Cable the port.
