You need to make sure that the physical ports on node1 map correctly to the physical ports on node3, which will let node3 communicate with other nodes in the cluster and with the network after the upgrade.

.Before you begin

You must already have information about the ports on the new nodes from the _Hardware Universe_.  (Go to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _Hardware Universe_).  You use the information later in this section and in link:map_ports_node2_node4.html[Map ports from node2 to node4].

The software configuration of node3 must match the physical connectivity of node3, and IP connectivity must be restored before you continue with the upgrade.

.About this task

Port settings might vary, depending on the model of the nodes.
