Before you netboot the system, you must ensure that all the SnapMirror relationship are quiesced. When a SnapMirror relationship is quiesced, it remains quiesced across reboots and failovers.

.Steps

. Verify the SnapMirror relationship status on the destination cluster:
+
`snapmirror show`
+
NOTE: If the status is `Transferring`, you must abort those transfers:
`snapmirror abort -destination-vserver <vserver name>`
+

The abort fails if the SnapMirror relationship is not in the `Transferring` state.

. Quiesce all relationships between the cluster:
+
`snapmirror quiesce -destination-vserver <vserver-name>`
