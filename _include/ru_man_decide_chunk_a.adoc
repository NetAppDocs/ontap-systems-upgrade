This procedure describes how to use manual aggregate relocation (ARL) to upgrade the storage controllers in an HA pair with new controllers while keeping all the existing data and disks. You should only use this complex procedure if you are an experienced administrator.

Use this content under the following circumstances:

* You do not want to add the new controllers as a new HA pair to the cluster and migrate the data using volume moves.
* You are experienced in administering ONTAP and are comfortable with the risks of working in the diagnostic privilege mode.
