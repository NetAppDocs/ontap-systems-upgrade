To help verify that you have the correct configuration after moving SAN LIFs from node3 to node4, you can use the following worksheet to record the `adapter` and `switch-port` information for each LIF.

Record the LIF `adapter` information from the `network interface show -data-protocol fc*` command output and the `switch-port` information from the `fcp adapter show -fields switch-port,fc-wwpn` command output for node3.

After you complete the migration to node4, record the LIF `adapter` and `switch-port` information for the LIFs on node4 and verify that each LIF is still connected to the same `switch-port`.
