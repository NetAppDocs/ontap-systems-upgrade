== Quiesce the SnapMirror relationships (optional)

Before continuing with the procedure, you must confirm that all the SnapMirror relationships are quiesced. When a SnapMirror relationship is quiesced, it remains quiesced across reboots and failovers.

.Steps

. Verify the SnapMirror relationship status on the destination cluster:
+
`snapmirror show`
+
[NOTE]
====
If the status is "Transferring", you must abort those transfers:
`snapmirror abort -destination-vserver _vserver_name_`
====
+
The abort fails if the SnapMirror relationship is not in the "Transferring" state.

. Quiesce all relationships between the cluster:
+
`snapmirror quiesce -destination-vserver *`
