Before you proceed with the procedure, you must confirm that all the SnapMirror relationships are quiesced. When a SnapMirror relationship is quiesced, it remains quiesced across reboots and failovers.

.Steps

. Verify the SnapMirror relationship status on the destination cluster by using the following command:
+
`snapmirror show`
+
NOTE: If the status is "Transferring", you must abort those transfers by using the following command: `snapmirror abort -destination-vserver <vserver name>`
+

The abort fails if the SnapMirror relationship is not in the "Transferring" state.

. Quiesce all relationships between the cluster by using the following command:
+
`snapmirror quiesce -destination-vserver <Vserver name>`
