[NOTE]
====
* If you're upgrading a system by swapping controller modules in the same chassis, such as AFF A800 or AFF C800, NetApp strongly recommends using the upgrade procedure that link:../upgrade-arl-auto-in-chassis/index.html[upgrades controller models using ARL, keeping the existing system chassis and disks]. This ARL procedure includes the steps that ensure the internal disks remain secure in the chassis when you remove and install the controllers during the upgrade procedure.

* You can use NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE), NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE), and NetApp Aggregate Encryption (NAE) with this procedure.

If you prefer a different method of upgrading the controller hardware and are willing to do volume moves, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to _Upgrade by moving volumes or storage_.
