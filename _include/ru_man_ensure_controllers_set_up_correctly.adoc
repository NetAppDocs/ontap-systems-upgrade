To confirm correct setup, you must enable the HA pair. You must also verify that node3 and node4 can access each other's storage and that neither owns data LIFs belonging to other nodes on the cluster. In addition, you must confirm that node3 owns node1's aggregates and that node4 owns node2's aggregates, and that the volumes for both nodes are online.

.Steps

. Enable storage failover by entering the following command on one of the nodes:
+
`storage failover modify -enabled true -node _node3_`

. Verify that storage failover is enabled:
+
`storage failover show`
+
The following example shows the output of the command when storage failover is enabled:
+
----
cluster::> storage failover show
                              Takeover
Node           Partner        Possible State Description
-------------- -------------- -------- ------------------
node3          node4          true     Connected to node4
node4          node3          true     Connected to node3
----

. Take one of the following actions:
+
|===
|If the cluster is a... |Description

|Two-node cluster |Enable cluster high availability by entering the following command on either node:
`cluster ha modify -configured true`
|Cluster with more than two nodes
|Go to <<man_ensure_setup_Step4,Step 4>>.
|===

. [[man_ensure_setup_Step4]]Verify that node3 and node4 belong to the same cluster by entering the following command and examining the output:
+
`cluster show`

. Verify that node3 and node4 can access each other's storage by entering the following command and examining the output:
+
`storage failover show -fields local-missing-disks,partner-missing-disks`

. Verify that neither node3 nor node4 owns data LIFs home-owned by other nodes in the cluster by entering the following command and examining the output:
+
`network interface show`
+
If either node3 or node4 owns data LIFs home-owned by other nodes in the cluster, use the `network interface revert` command to revert the data LIFs to their home-owner.

. Verify that node3 owns the aggregates from node1 and that node4 owns the aggregates from node2:
+
`storage aggregate show -owner-name _node3_`
`storage aggregate show -owner-name _node4_`

. Determine whether any volumes are offline:
+
`volume show -node _node3_ -state offline`
`volume show -node _node4_ -state offline`

. If any volumes are offline, compare them with the list of offline volumes that you captured in  link:prepare_nodes_for_upgrade.html#step19d[Step 19 (d)] in _Prepare the nodes for upgrade_, and bring online any of the offline volumes, as required, by entering the following command, once for each volume:
+
`volume online -vserver _vserver_name_ -volume _volume_name_`

. Install new licenses for the new nodes by entering the following command for each node:
+
`system license add -license-code _license_code,license_code,license_code..._`
+
The license-code parameter accepts a list of 28 upper-case alphabetic character keys. You can add one license at a time, or you can add multiple licenses at once, each license key separated by a comma.

. If self-encrypting drives are being used in the configuration and you have set the `kmip.init.maxwait` variable to `off` (for example, in link:install_boot_node3.html#step16[Step 16] of _Install and boot node3_), you must unset the variable:
+
`set diag; systemshell -node _node_name_ -command sudo kenv -u -p kmip.init.maxwait`

. To remove all of the old licenses from the original nodes, enter one of the following commands:
+
`system license clean-up -unused -expired`
`system license delete -serial-number _node_serial_number_ -package _licensable_package_`

* To delete all expired licenses, enter:
+
`system license clean-up -expired`
* To delete all unused licenses, enter:
+
`system license clean-up -unused`
* To delete a specific license from a cluster, enter the following commands on the nodes:
+
`system license delete -serial-number _node1_serial_number_ -package *`
`system license delete -serial-number _node2_serial_number_ -package *`
+
The following output is displayed:
+
----
Warning: The following licenses will be removed:
<list of each installed package>
Do you want to continue? {y|n}: y
----
Enter `y` to remove all of the packages.

. Verify that the licenses are correctly installed by entering the following command and examining its output:
+
`system license show`
+
You can compare the output with the output that you captured in link:prepare_nodes_for_upgrade.html#step30[Step 30] of _Prepare the nodes for upgrade_.

. Configure the SPs by performing the following command on both nodes:
+
`system service-processor network modify -node _node_name_`
+
Go to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _System Administration Reference_ for information about the SPs and the _ONTAP 9 Commands: Manual Page Reference_ for detailed information about the `system service- processor network modify` command.

. If you want to set up a switchless cluster on the new nodes, go to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _Network Support Site_ and follow the instructions in _Transitioning to a two-node switchless cluster_.

.After you finish

If Storage Encryption is enabled on node3 and node4, complete the steps in link:set_up_storage_encryption_new_controller.html[Set up Storage Encryption on the new controller module]. Otherwise, complete the steps in link:decommission_old_system.html[Decommission the old system].
