== Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node3

If node3 has onboard UTA/UTA2 ports or a UTA/UTA2 card, you must check the configuration of the ports and possibly reconfigure them, depending on how you want to use the upgraded system.

.Before you begin

You must have the correct SFP+ modules for the UTA/UTA2 ports.

.About this task

If you want to use a Unified Target Adapter (UTA/UTA2) port for FC, you must first verify how the port is configured.

NOTE: NetApp marketing materials might use the term UTA2 to refer to CNA adapters and ports. However, the CLI uses the term CNA.

You can use the `ucadmin show` command to verify the current port configuration:

----
*> ucadmin show
          Current  Current    Pending  Pending    Admin
 Adapter  Mode     Type       Mode     Type       Status
 -------  -------  ---------  -------  ---------  -----------
 0e       fc       target     -        initiator  offline
 0f       fc       target     -        initiator  offline
 0g       fc       target     -        initiator  offline
 0h       fc       target     -        initiator  offline
 1a       fc       target     -        -          online
 1b       fc       target     -        -          online

UTA/UTA2 ports can be configured into native FC mode or UTA/UTA2 mode. FC mode supports FC initiator and FC target; UTA/UTA2 mode allows concurrent NIC and FCoE traffic sharing the same 10 GbE SFP+ interface and supports FC targets.

UTA/UTA2 ports might be found on an adapter or on the controller, and have the following configurations, but you should check the configuration of the UTA/UTA2 ports on the node3 and change it, if necessary:

* UTA/UTA2 cards ordered when the controller is ordered are configured before shipment to have the personality you request.
* UTA/UTA2 cards ordered separately from the controller are shipped with the default FC target personality.
* Onboard UTA/UTA2 ports on new controllers are configured before shipment to have the personality you request.
+
NOTE: *Attention*: If your system has storage disks, you enter the commands in this section at the cluster prompt unless directed to enter maintenance mode. If you have a VSeries system or have FlexArray Virtualization Software and are connected to storage arrays, you enter commands in this section at the maintenance mode prompt. You must be in maintenance mode to configure UTA/UTA2 ports.

.Steps

. [[step1]]Check how the ports are currently configured entering on of the following commands on node3:

|If the system... |Then...

|Has storage disks
|`system node hardware unified-connect show`
|Is a V-Series system or has FlexArray Virtualization Software and is connected to storage arrays
|`ucadmin show`

The system displays output similar to the following examples:

. [[step2]]If the current SFP+ module does not match the desired use, replace it with the correct SFP+ module.
+
Contact your NetApp representative to obtain the correct SFP+ module.

. [[step3]]Examine the output of the `system node hardware unified-connect show` or `ucadmin show` command to determine whether the UTA/UTA2 ports have the personality you want.

. [[step4]]Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols="35,65"]
|===
|If the UTA/UTA2 ports... |Then...

|Do not have the personality that you want
|Go to <<man_check_3_step5,Step 5>>.
|Have the personality that you want
|Skip Step 5 through Step 12 and go to <<man_check_3_step13,Step 13>>.
|===

. [[man_check_3_step5]]Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols="35,65"]
|===
|If the system... |Then...

|Has storage disks and is running clustered Data ONTAP 8.3
|Boot node3 and enter maintenance mode:

`boot_ontap maint`
|Is a V-Series system or has FlexArray Virtualization Software and is connected to storage arrays
|Go to <<man_check_3_step6,Step 6>>.

You should already be in maintenance mode.
|===

. [[man_check_3_step6]]Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols="35,65"]
|===
|If you are configuring... |Then...

|Ports on a UTA/UTA2 card
|Go to <<man_check_3_step7,Step 7>>.
|Onboard UTA/UTA2 ports
|Skip Step 7 and go to <<man_check_3_step8,Step 8>>.
|===

. [[man_check_3_step7]]If the adapter is in initiator mode, and if the UTA/UTA2 port is online, take the UTA/UTA2 port offline:
+
`storage disable adapter <adapter_name>`
+
Adapters in target mode are automatically offline in maintenance mode.

. [[man_check_3_step8]]If the current configuration does not match the desired use, change the configuration as needed:
+
`ucadmin modify -m fc|cna -t initiator|target <adapter_name>`
+
* `-m` is the personality mode, `fc` or `cna`.
* `-t` is the FC4 type, `target` or `initiator`.
+
NOTE: You need to use the FC initiator for tape drives, FlexArray Virtualization systems, and MetroCluster configurations. You need to use the FC target for SAN clients.

. Verify the settings:
+
`ucadmin show`

. Verify the settings:
