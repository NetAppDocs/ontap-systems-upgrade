* For some ARL controller upgrades you can use temporary cluster ports on the replacement controller for the upgrade. For example, if you upgrade from an AFF A300 to an AFF A400 system, depending on the AFF A400 configuration, you can use any of the two mezzanine ports or add a four-port 10 GbE network interface card to provide temporary cluster ports. After you complete a controller upgrade using temporary cluster ports, you can nondisruptively migrate clusters to 100 GbE ports on the replacement controller.

* Controller upgrade using ARL is supported on systems configured with SnapLock Enterprise and SnapLock Compliance volumes.

You should verify whether the ARL can be performed on the original and replacement controllers. You should check the size of all defined aggregates and number of disks supported by the original system. Then compare them with the aggregate size and number of disks supported by the new system. To access this information, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _Hardware Universe_. The aggregate size and the number of disks supported by the new system must be equal to or greater than the aggregate size and number of disks supported by the original system.

You should validate in the cluster mixing rules whether new nodes can become part of the cluster with the existing nodes when the original controller is replaced. For more information about cluster mixing rules, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _Hardware Universe_.

NOTE: Both systems are either high-availability (HA) or non-HA. Both nodes must either have the personality enabled or disabled; you cannot combine a node with the All Flash Optimized personality enabled with a node that does not have the personality enabled in the same HA pair. If the personalities are different, contact technical support.

NOTE: If the new system has fewer slots than the original system, or if it has fewer or different ports, you might need to add an adapter to the new system. Refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _Hardware Universe_ on the NetApp Support Site for details about specific platforms.
