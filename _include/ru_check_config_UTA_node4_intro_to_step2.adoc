If node4 has onboard UTA/UTA2 ports or a UTA/UTA2A card, you must check the configuration of the ports and configure them, depending on how you want to use the upgraded system.

.Before you begin

You must have the correct SFP+ modules for the UTA/UTA2 ports.

.About this task

UTA/UTA2 ports can be configured into native FC mode or UTA/UTA2A mode. FC mode supports FC initiator and FC target; UTA/UTA2 mode allows concurrent NIC and FCoE traffic to share the same 10 GbE SFP+ interface and supports FC target.

NOTE: NetApp marketing materials might use the term UTA2 to refer to CNA adapters and ports. However, the CLI uses the term CNA.

UTA/UTA2 ports might be on an adapter or on the controller with the following configurations:

* UTA/UTA2 cards ordered at the same time as the controller are configured before shipment to have the personality you requested.
* UTA/UTA2 cards ordered separately from the controller are shipped with the default FC target personality.
* Onboard UTA/UTA2 ports on new controllers are configured (before shipment) to have the personality you requested.

However, you should check the configuration of the UTA/UTA2 ports on node4 and change it, if necessary.

*Attention*: If your system has storage disks, you enter the commands in this section at the cluster prompt unless directed to enter Maintenance mode. If you have a MetroCluster FC system, V-Series system or a system with FlexArray Virtualization software that is connected to storage arrays,  you must be in Maintenance mode to configure UTA/UTA2 ports.

.Steps

. Check how the ports are currently configured by using one of the following commands on node4:
+
|===
|If the system... |Thenâ€¦

|Has storage disks
|`system node hardware unified-connect show`
|Is a V-Series system or has FlexArray Virtualization Software and is connected to storage arrays
|`ucadmin show`
|===
+
The system displays output similar to the following examples:
+
....
*> ucadmin show
                Current  Current    Pending   Pending   Admin
Node   Adapter  Mode     Type       Mode      Type      Status
----   -------  ---      ---------  -------   --------  -------
f-a    0e       fc       initiator  -          -        online
f-a    0f       fc       initiator  -          -        online
f-a    0g       cna      target     -          -        online
f-a    0h       cna      target     -          -        online
f-a    0e       fc       initiator  -          -        online
f-a    0f       fc       initiator  -          -        online
f-a    0g       cna      target     -          -        online
f-a    0h       cna      target     -          -        online
*>
....

. If the current SFP+ module does not match the desired use, replace it with the correct SFP+ module.

Contact your NetApp representative to obtain the correct SFP+ module.
