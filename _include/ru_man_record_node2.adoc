Before you can shut down and retire node2, you need to record information about its cluster network, management, and FC ports as well as its NVRAM System ID. You need that information later in the procedure when you map node2 to node4 and reassign disks.

.Steps

. Find the cluster network, node-management, intercluster, and cluster-management ports on node2:
+
`network interface show -curr-node <node_name> -role cluster,intercluster,nodemgmt,cluster-mgmt`
+
The system displays the LIFs for that node and other nodes in the cluster, as shown in the following example:
+
----
cluster::> network interface show -curr-node node2 -role
cluster,intercluster,node-mgmt,cluster-mgmt
         Logical     Status     Network            Current     Current Is
Vserver  Interface   Admin/Oper Address/Mask       Node        Port    Home
-------- ----------  ---------- ------------------ ----------  ------- ----
node2
         intercluster up/up     192.168.1.202/24   node2       e0e     true
         clus1        up/up     169.254.xx.xx/24   node2       e0a     true
         clus2        up/up     169.254.xx.xx/24   node2       e0b     true
         mgmt1        up/up     192.168.0.xxx/24   node2       e0c     true
4 entries were displayed.

+
NOTE: Your system might not have intercluster LIFs. You will have a cluster management LIF only on one node of a node pair. A cluster management LIF was displayed in the example output of link:record_node1_information.html#step[Step 1] in _Record node1 port information_.

. Capture the information in the output to use in the section link:map_ports_node2_node4.html[Map ports from node2 to node4].
+
The output information is required to map the new controller ports to the old controller ports.

. Determine physical ports on node2:
+
`network port show -node <node_name> -type physical` +
+
`node_name` is the node which is being migrated.
+
The system displays the physical ports on node2, as shown in the following example:
+
----
cluster::> network port show -node node2 -type physical

5 entries were displayed.

. Record the ports and their broadcast domains.
+
The broadcast domains will need to be mapped to the ports on the new controller later in the procedure.

. Determine the FC ports on node2:
+
`network fcp adapter show`
+
The system displays the FC ports on the node2, as shown in the following example:
+
----
cluster::> network fcp adapter show -node node2
                     Connection  Host
Node         Adapter Established Port Address
------------ ------- ----------- ------------
node2
             0a      ptp         11400
node2
             0c      ptp         11700
node2
             6a      loop        0
node2
             6b      loop        0
4 entries were displayed.
----

. Record the ports.
+
The output information is required to map the new FC ports on the new controller later in the procedure.

. If you have not done so earlier, check whether there are interface groups or VLANs configured on node2:
+
`ifgrp show`
+
`vlan show`
+
You will use the information in the section link:map_ports_node2_node4.html[Map ports from node2 to node4].

. Take one of the following actions:
