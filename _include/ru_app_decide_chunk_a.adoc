This guide describes how to upgrade the storage controllers in an HA pair with new controllers while keeping all the existing data and disks. This is a complex procedure that should be used only by experienced administrators.

You should use this guide under the following circumstances:

* You are running ONTAP 9.8.
* You do not want to add the new controllers as a new HA pair to the cluster and migrate the data using volume moves.
* You are experienced in administering ONTAP and are comfortable with the risks of working in the diagnostic privilege mode.
