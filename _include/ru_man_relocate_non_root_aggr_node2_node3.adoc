Before you can replace node2 with node4, you must send an AutoSupport message for node2 and then relocate the non-root aggregates that are owned by node2 to node3.

.Steps

. [[step1]] Send an AutoSupport message to NetApp for node2:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node <node2> -type all -message "Upgrading <node2> from <platform_old> to <platform_new>"`

. Verify that the AutoSupport message was sent:
+
`system node autosupport show -node <node2> -instance`
+
The fields "Last Subject Sent:"" and "Last Time Sent:"" contain the message title of the last message that was sent and the time when the message was sent.

. [[step3]]Relocate the non-root aggregates:

.. Set the privilege level to advanced:
+
`set -privilege advanced`

.. List the aggregates that are owned by node2:
+
`storage aggregate show -owner-name <node2>`

.. Start aggregate relocation:
+
`storage aggregate relocation start -node <node2> -destination <node3> -aggregate-list * -ndo-controller-upgrade true`
+
NOTE: The command locates only non-root aggregates.

.. When prompted, enter `y`.
+
Relocation occurs in the background. It can take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes to relocate an aggregate. The time includes both client outage and non-outage portions. The command does not relocate any offline or restricted aggregates.

.. Return to the admin privilege level:
+
`set -privilege admin`

. Verify the relocation status of node2:
+
`storage aggregate relocation show -node <node2>`
+
The output will display "Done" for an aggregate after it has been relocated.
+
NOTE: You must wait until all of the aggregates that are owned by node2 have been relocated to node3 before proceeding to the next step.

. Take one of the following actions:

+
`storage aggregate show -instance`
+
You can also check the EMS logs to see the corrective action that is needed.
+
*Note*: The `event log show` command lists any errors that have occurred.

.. Perform the corrective action.

.. Set the privilege level to advanced:
+
`set -privilege advanced`

.. Relocate any failed or vetoed aggregates:
+
`storage aggregate relocation start -node <node2> -destination <node3> -aggregate-list * -ndo-controllerupgrade true`

.. When prompted, enter `y`.

.. Return to the admin privilege level:
+
`set -privilege admin`

If necessary, you can force the relocation by using one of the following methods:

* By overriding veto checks:
+
`storage aggregate relocation start -override-vetoes true -ndo-controller-upgrade`

* By overriding destination checks:
+
`storage aggregate relocation start -override-destination-checks true -ndocontroller-upgrade`

. [[man_relocate_2_3_step6]]Verify that all of the non-root aggregates are online on node3:
+
`storage aggregate show -node <node3> -state offline -root false`
+
If any aggregates have gone offline or have become foreign, you must bring them online, once for each aggregate:
+
`storage aggregate online -aggregate <aggr_name>`

. Verify that all of the volumes are online on node3:
+
`volume show -node <node3> -state offline`
+
If any volumes are offline on node3, you must bring them online, once for each volume:
+
`volume online -vserver <Vserver-name> -volume <volume-name>`

. Verify that node2 does not own any online non-root aggregates:
+
`storage aggregate show -owner-name <node2> -ha-policy sfo -state online`
+
The command output should not display online non-root aggregates because all of the non-root online aggregates have already been relocated to node3.
