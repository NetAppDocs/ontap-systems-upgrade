During Stage 2, you relocate node1 non-root aggregates and NAS data LIFs to node2. This process is largely automated; the operation pauses to enable you to check its status. You must manually resume the operation. If required, you relocate failed or vetoed aggregates. You record node1 information for use later in the procedure before retiring node1. You can also prepare to netboot node3 and node4 later in the procedure.
