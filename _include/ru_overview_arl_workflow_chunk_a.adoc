Before you upgrade the nodes using ARL, you should understand how the procedure works. In this document, the procedure is broken down into several stages.

During the procedure, you upgrade the original controller hardware with the replacement controller hardware, one controller at a time, taking advantage of the HA pair configuration to relocate the ownership of non-root aggregates. All non-root aggregates must undergo two relocations to reach their final destination, which is the correct upgraded node.

Each aggregate has a home owner and current owner. The home owner is the actual owner of the aggregate, and the current owner is the temporary owner.
