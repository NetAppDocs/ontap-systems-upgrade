Before you start the upgrade, you must verify that your upgrade kit is for upgrading from an AFF A700 to an AFF A900 system. The kit should contain a minimum of two system controller modules and two NVS modules per HA pair that is required to be upgraded. If there are parts missing, contact technical support for assistance.
