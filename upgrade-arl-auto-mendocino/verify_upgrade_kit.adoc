Before you start the upgrade, you must verify that your upgrade kit is for upgrading from an AFF A700 to an AFF A900 system. For each HA pair that your are upgrading, the kit should contain a minimum of two system controller modules and two NVS modules. If there are parts missing, contact technical support for assistance.
