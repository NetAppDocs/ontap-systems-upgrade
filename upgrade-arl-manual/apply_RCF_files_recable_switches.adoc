You must apply the appropriate reference configuration files (RCFs) to reconfigure your switches to accommodate the new nodes. After you apply the RCFs, you can recable the switches.

.Before you begin

The FC switch port usage must match the usage described in the _Fabric-attached MetroCluster Installation and Configuration_ content so that the RCFs can be used. Go to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _Fabric-attached MetroCluster Installation and Configuration_ content.

.Steps

. Go to the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/metrocluster-rcf/downloads-tab[MetroCluster RCF downloads^] page and select the RCFs for your switch configuration.
+
You must use the RCFs that match your switch model.
+
. Install your FC switch RCF by selecting the procedure for your switch type and following the installation instructions:

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-fc/task_install_the_brocade_fc_switch_rcf_file.html[Install a Brocade FC switch RCF^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-fc/task_download_and_install_the_cisco_fc_switch_rcf_files.html[Install a Cisco FC switch RCF^]

. Verify that the switch configuration is saved.

. Cable both of the FC-to-SAS bridges to the FC switches, using the cabling layout you created in link:determine_new_cabling_layout.html[Determine the new cabling layout].

. Verify that the ports are online:
+
* For Brocade switches, use the `switchshow` command.
* For Cisco switches, use the show `interface brief` command.

. Cable the FC-VI ports from the controllers to the switches.

. From the existing nodes, verify that the FC-VI ports are online:
