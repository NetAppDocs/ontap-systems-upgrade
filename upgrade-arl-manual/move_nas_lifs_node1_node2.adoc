[.lead]
Before you can replace node1 with node3, you need to move the NAS data LIFs owned by node1 to node2 if you have a two-node cluster, or to a third node if your cluster has more than two nodes. The method you use depends on whether the cluster is configured for NAS or SAN.

.About this task

Remote LIFs handle traffic to SAN LUNs during the upgrade procedure. Moving SAN LIFs is not necessary for cluster or service health during the upgrade. You must verify that the LIFs are healthy and located on appropriate ports after you bring node3 online.

.Steps

.	List all the NAS data LIFs hosted on node1 by entering the following command and capturing the output:
+
`network interface show -data-protocol nfs|cifs -curr-node <node1>`
+
The system displays the NAS data LIFs on node1, as shown in the following example:
+
----
 cluster::> network interface show -data-protocol nfs|cifs -curr-node node1

. Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols="40,60"]
|===
|If node1... |Then...

|Has interface groups of VLANs configured
|Go to <<man_move_lif_1_2_step3,Step 3>>.
|Does not have interface groups or VLANs configured
|Skip Step 3 and go to <<man_move_lif_1_2_step4,Step 4>>.
|===
+
Use the `network port vlan show` command to display information about the network ports attached to VLANs, and use the `network port ifgrp show` command to display information about the port interface groups.

.	[[man_move_lif_1_2_step3]]Take the following steps to migrate any NAS data LIFs hosted on interface groups and VLANs on node1:

.. [[man_move_lif_1_2_substepa]]Migrate the LIFs hosted on any interface groups and the VLANs on node1 to a port on node2 that is capable of hosting LIFs on the same network as that of the interface groups by entering the following command, once for each LIF:
+
`network interface migrate -vserver <Vserver_name> -lif <LIF_name> -destination-node <node2> –destination-port <netport|ifgrp>`

..	Modify the home port and the home node of the LIFs and VLANs in <<man_move_lif_1_2_substepa,Substep a>> to the port and node currently hosting the LIFs by entering the following command, once for each LIF:
+
`network interface modify -vserver <Vserver_name> -lif <LIF_name> -home-node <node2> - home-port <netport|ifgrp>`

.	[[man_move_lif_1_2_step4]]Take one of the following actions:
+
[cols="20,80"]
|===
|If the cluster is configured for... |Then...

|NAS
|Complete <<man_move_lif_1_2_step5,Step 5>> through <<man_move_lif_1_2_step8,Step 8>>.
|SAN
|Disable all the SAN LIFs on the node to take them down for the upgrade:

`network interface modify -vserver <Vserver-name> -lif <LIF_name> -home-node <node_to_upgrade> -home-port <netport\|ifgrp> -status-admin down`
|===

.	[[man_move_lif_1_2_step5]]Migrate NAS data LIFs from node1 to node2 by entering the following command, once for each data LIF:
+
`network interface migrate -vserver <Vserver-name> -lif <LIF_name> -destination-node <node2> -destination-port <data_port>`

.	[[step6]]Enter the following command and examine its output to verify that LIFs have been moved to the correct ports and that the LIFs have the status of up by entering the following command on either node and examining the output:
+
`network interface show -curr-node <node2> -data-protocol nfs|cifs`

.	[[step7]]Enter the following command to modify the home node of the migrated LIFs:
+
`network interface modify -vserver <Vserver-name> -lif <LIF_name> -home-node <node2> -home-port <port_name>`

.	[[man_move_lif_1_2_step8]]Verify whether the LIF is using the port as its home or current port. If the port is not home or current port then go to <<man_move_lif_1_2_step9,Step 9>>:
+
`network interface show -home-node <node2> -home-port <port_name>`
+
`network interface show -curr-node <node_name> -curr-port <port_name>`

.	[[man_move_lif_1_2_step9]]If the LIFs are using the port as a home port or current port, then modify the LIF to use a different port:
+
`network interface migrate -vserver <Vserver-name> -lif <LIF_name> -destination–node <node_name> -destination-port <port_name>`
+
`network interface modify -vserver <Vserver-name> -lif <LIF_name> -home–node <node_name> -home-port <port_name>`

. [[step10]]If the ports currently hosting data LIFs are not going to exist on the new hardware, remove them from the broadcast domain now:
+
`network port broadcast-domain remove-ports -ipspace Default -broadcast-domain Default -ports <node:port>`

.	[[step11]]If any LIFs are down, set the administrative status of the LIFs to "up" by entering  the following command, once for each LIF:
+
`network interface modify -vserver <Vserver-name> -lif <LIF_name> -home-node <nodename> -status-admin up`
+
NOTE: For MetroCluster configurations, you might not be able to change the broadcast domain of a port because it is associated with a port hosting the LIF of a destination storage virtual machine (SVM). Enter the following command from the corresponding source SVM on the remote site to reallocate the destination LIF to an appropriate port:
`metrocluster vserver resync -vserver <Vserver_name>`

.	[[step12]]Enter the following command and examine its output to verify that there are no data LIFs remaining on node1:
+
`network interface show -curr-node <node1> -role data`

. [[step13]]If you have interface groups or VLANs configured, complete the following substeps:

.. Remove the VLANs from the interface groups by entering the following command:
+
`network port vlan delete -node <nodename> -port <ifgrp_name> -vlan-id <VLAN_ID>`

.. Enter the following command and examine its output to see if there are any interface groups configured on the node:
+
`network port ifgrp show -node <nodename> -ifgrp <ifgrp_name> -instance`
+
The system displays interface group information for the node as shown in the following example:
+
----
  cluster::> network port ifgrp show -node node1 -ifgrp a0a -instance
                   Node: node1
   Interface Group Name: a0a
  Distribution Function: ip
          Create Policy: multimode_lacp
            MAC Address: 02:a0:98:17:dc:d4
     Port Participation: partial
          Network Ports: e2c, e2d
               Up Ports: e2c
             Down Ports: e2d
----

.. If any interface groups are configured on the node, record the names of those groups and the ports assigned to them, and then delete the ports by entering the following command, once for each port:
+
`network port ifgrp remove-port -node <nodename> -ifgrp <ifgrp_name> -port <netport>`
