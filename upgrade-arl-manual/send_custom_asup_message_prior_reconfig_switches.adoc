[.lead]
Before reconfiguring your switches, you should issue an AutoSupport message to notify NetApp technical support that maintenance is underway. Informing technical support that maintenance is underway prevents them from opening a case on the assumption that a disruption has occurred.

.About this task

This task must be performed on each MetroCluster site.

.Steps

. Log in to the cluster.

. Invoke an AutoSupport message indicating the start of the maintenance:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=<maintenance-window-in-hours>`
+
The `maintenance-window-in-hours` value specifies the length of the maintenance window, with a maximum of 72 hours. If the maintenance is completed before the time has elapsed, you can invoke an AutoSupport message indicating the end of the maintenance period:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node * -type all -message MAINT=end`

. Repeat these steps on the partner site.
