If node3 has onboard FC ports, onboard unified target adapter (UTA/UTA2) ports, or a UTA/UTA2 card, you must configure the settings before completing the rest of the procedure.

.About this task

You might need to complete <<Configure FC ports on node3>> or <<Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node3>>, or both sections.

NOTE: NetApp marketing materials might use the term "UTA2" to refer to CNA adapters and ports. However, the CLI uses the term "CNA".

If node3 does not have onboard FC ports, onboard UTA/UTA2 ports, or a UTA/UTA2 card, and you are upgrading a system with storage disks, you can skip to link:map_ports_node1_node3.html[Map ports from node1 to node3].
