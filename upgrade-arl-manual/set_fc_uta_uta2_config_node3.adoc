If node3 has onboard FC ports, onboard unified target adapter (UTA/UTA2) ports, or a UTA/UTA2 card, you must configure the settings before completing the rest of the procedure.

.About this task

You might need to complete <<Configure FC ports on node3>>, or <<Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node3>>, or both sections.

NOTE: NetApp marketing materials might use the term "UTA2" to refer to CNA adapters and ports. However, the CLI uses the term "CNA".

* If node3 does not have onboard FC ports, onboard UTA/UTA2 ports, or a UTA/UTA2 card, and you are upgrading a system with storage disks, you can skip to link:map_ports_node1_node3.html[Map ports from node1 to node3].

* However, if you have a V-Series system or a system with FlexArray Virtualization software with storage arrays, and node3 does not have onboard FC ports, onboard UTA/UTA ports, or a UTA/UTA2 card, return to _Install and boot node3_ and resume at link:install_boot_node3.html#man_install3_step22[Step 22].
