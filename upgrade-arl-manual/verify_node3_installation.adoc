After you install and boot node3, you must verify that it is installed correctly, that it is part of the cluster, and that it can communicate with node2.

.Steps

. [[step1]]At the system prompt, log in to node3. Then, verify that node3 is both part of the same cluster as node2 and healthy:
+
`cluster show`

. [[step2]]Verify that node3 can communicate with node2 and that all LIFs are up:
+
`network interface show -curr-node <node3>`

. [[step3]]Take one of the following actions:

|Complete <<step4,Step 4>> and then go to the section link:move_nas_lifs_node1_from_node2_node3_verify_san_lifs_node3.html[Moving NAS data LIFs owned by node1 from node2 to node3 and verifying SAN LIFs on node3].
|Not in a SAN environment
|Skip Step 4 and go to link:move_nas_lifs_node1_from_node2_node3_verify_san_lifs_node3.html[Moving NAS data LIFs owned by node1 from node2 to node3 and verifying SAN LIFs on node3].

. [[step4]] Verify that node2 and node3 are in quorum by entering the following command on one of the nodes and examining its output:
+
`event log show -messagename scsiblade.*`
+
The following example shows the output when the nodes in the cluster are in quorum:
