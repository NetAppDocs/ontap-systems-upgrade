If node4 has onboard FC ports, onboard unified target adapter (UTA/UTA2) ports, or a UTA/UTA2 card, you must configure the settings before completing the rest of the procedure.

.About this task

You might need to complete <<Configure FC ports on node4>> or <<Check and configure UTA/UTA2 ports on node4>>, or both sections.

If node4 does not have onboard FC ports, onboard UTA/UTA2 ports, or a UTA/UTA2 card, and you are upgrading a system with storage disks, you can skip to link:map_ports_node2_node4.html[Map ports from node2 to node4].
