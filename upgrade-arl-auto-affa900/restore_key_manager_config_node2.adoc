If you are using NetApp Aggregate Encryption (NAE) or NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE) to encrypt volumes on the system that you are upgrading, the encryption configuration must be synchronized to the new nodes. If you do not restore key-manager, when you relocate the node2 aggregates from the upgraded node1 to the upgraded node2 by using ARL, encrypted volumes will be taken offline.
