During Stage 1, you verify that you have the correct hardware for an AFF A700 to AFF A900 or a FAS9000 to a FAS9500 upgrade, run prechecks and, if required, correct aggregate ownership. You must record certain information if you are managing Storage Encryption by using OKM and you can choose to quiesce the SnapMirror relationships.
