This content describes how to upgrade storage controllers in a HA pair while keeping all the existing data and disks. This is a complex procedure that should be used only by experienced administrators.

You can use this procedure under the following circumstances:

* You are performing one of the following controller upgrades:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="50,50"]
|===
|Old controller
|Replacement controller

|AFF A800
|AFF A70 and AFF A90
|AFF A220 configured as an ASA
|ASA A150
|AFF A220, AFF A200, or AFF C190
|AFF A150
|FAS2620 or FAS2720
|FAS2820
|AFF A700 configured as an ASA
|ASA A900
|AFF A700
|AFF A900 
|FAS9000
|FAS9500
|===

* You have verified with your NetApp sales representative that you have received the hardware for your controller upgrade:
** Two AFF A90 or two AFF A70 controllers and all I/O modules required for the upgrade. The required length of 100GbE cables. 
** ASA A150, AFF A150, or FAS2820 controller
** ASA A900, AFF A900, or FAS9500 controller and NVRAM modules and the parts required for the upgrade

* You are running the minimum ONTAP version for your upgrade. For more information, see link:index.html[Overview].
* You do not want to add the new controllers as a new HA pair to the cluster and migrate the data by using volume moves.
* You are experienced in administering ONTAP and are comfortable with the risks of working in diagnostic privilege mode.

* Your systems are running ONTAP 9.15.1 or later and using a shared switch for either cluster-interconnect and Ethernet attached storage or just for Ethernet attached storage.


You cannot use this procedure under the following circumstances:

* You are using FlexArray Virtualization Software on the AFF A800, AFF A700, or FAS9000 systems.
* Your systems are running ONTAP 9.14.1 or earlier and using a shared switch for cluster-interconnect and Ethernet attached storage. 

For upgrading MetroCluster IP configurations on AFF A800, AFF A700, or FAS9000 systems, see link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _MetroCluster Upgrade and Expansion_ content.

NOTE: You can use NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE), NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE), and NetApp Aggregate Encryption (NAE) with this procedure.

If you prefer a different method of upgrading the controller hardware and are willing to do volume moves, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to _Upgrade by moving volumes or storage_.
