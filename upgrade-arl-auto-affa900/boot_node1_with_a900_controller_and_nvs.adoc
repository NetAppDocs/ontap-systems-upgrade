Node1 with the AFF A900 or FAS9500 controller module and NVRAM module is now ready for boot up. An AFF A700 to an AFF A900 or a FAS9000 to a FAS9500 upgrade by swapping the controller and NVRAM modules involves moving only the console and management connections. This section provides the steps required to boot node1 with the AFF A900 or FAS9500 controller and NVRAM modules.

.Steps

.	If NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE) is in use on this configuration, the `setenv bootarg.storageencryption.support` command must be set to `true`, and the `kmip.init.maxwait` variable must be set to `off` to avoid a boot loop after the node1 configuration is loaded:
+
`setenv bootarg.storageencryption.support true`
+
`setenv kmip.init.maxwait off`
.	Boot the node into `boot_menu`:
+
`boot_ontap menu`
.	The node stops at the boot menu. Enter "22/7" and select the hidden option `boot_after_controller_replacement`. To reassign the node1 disks from the AFF A700 to the AFF A900 or from the FAS9000 to the FAS9500, at the prompt, enter the actual node name of node1. Use the following example as a reference:

[NOTE]
====
In the preceding console output example, ONTAP will prompt you for the partner node name if the system uses Advanced Disk Partitioning (ADP) disks.

The system IDs shown in the preceding example are example IDs. The actual system IDs of the nodes that you are upgrading will be different.

Between entering node names at the prompt and the login prompt, the node reboots a few times to restore the environment variables, update firmware on the cards in the system, and for other ONTAP updates.
