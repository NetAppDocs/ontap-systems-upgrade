[.lead]
Node1 with the AFF A900 or FAS9500 controller and NVRAM modules is now ready for boot up. An AFF A700 to AFF A900 or a FAS9000 to FAS9500 upgrade by swapping the controller and NVRAM modules involves moving only the console and management connections. This section provides the steps required to boot node1 with the AFF A900 or FAS9500 controller and NVRAM modules.

.Steps

. If you have NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE) drives installed, perform the following steps.
+
NOTE: If you have not already done so earlier in the procedure, see the Knowledge Base article https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/Hardware/How_to_tell_if_a_drive_is_FIPS_certified[How to tell if a drive is FIPS certified^] to determine the type of self-encrypting drives that are in use.
+
.. Set `bootarg.storageencryption.support` to `true` or `false`:
+ 
[cols="35,65"]
|===
|If the following drives are in use…	|Then…
|NSE drives that conform to FIPS 140-2 Level 2 self-encryption requirements
|`setenv bootarg.storageencryption.support *true*`
|NetApp non-FIPS SEDs
|`setenv bootarg.storageencryption.support *false*`
|===
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot mix FIPS drives with other types of drives on the same node or HA pair.
You can mix SEDs with non-encrypting drives on the same node or HA pair.
====
.. Go to the special boot menu and select option `(10) Set Onboard Key Manager recovery secrets`. 
+
Enter the passphrase and the backup information that you recorded earlier procedure. See link:manage_authentication_okm.html[Manage authentication keys using the Onboard Key Manager].

.	Boot the node into the boot menu:
+
`boot_ontap menu`
.	Reassign the AFF A700 node1 disks to AFF A900 node1 by entering "22/7" and selecting the hidden option `boot_after_controller_replacement` when the node stops at the boot menu.
+
After a short delay, you are prompted to enter the name of the node that is being replaced. If there are shared disks (also called Advanced Disk Partitioning (ADP) or partitioned disks), you are prompted to enter the node name of the HA partner.
+
These prompts might get buried in the console messages. If you do not enter a node name or enter an incorrect name, you are prompted to enter the name again.
+
[NOTE]
====
If `[localhost:disk.encryptNoSupport:ALERT]: Detected FIPS-certified encrypting drive` and, or, `[localhost:diskown.errorDuringIO:error]: error 3 (disk failed) on disk` errors occur, perform the following steps:

. Halt the node at the LOADER prompt.
. Check and reset the storage encryption bootargs mentioned in <<A900_boot_node1,Step 1>>.
. At the loader prompt, boot up:
+
`boot_ontap`

The system IDs shown in the preceding example are example IDs. The actual system IDs of the nodes that you are upgrading will be different.

Between entering node names at the prompt and the login prompt, the node reboots a few times to restore the environment variables, update firmware on the cards in the system, and for other ONTAP updates.
