Node1 with the replacement modules is now ready to boot. This section provides the steps required to boot node1 with the replacement modules for the following upgrade configurations:

[cols="35,65"]
|===
|Existing node1 controller |Replacement node1 system modules

|AFF A800
|AFF A90 or AFF A70 ^1^
|AFF A220 configured as an ASA
|AFF A150 controller module ^1^
|AFF A220	
AFF A200	
AFF C190
|AFF A150 controller module ^1^
|FAS2620 
FAS2720 
|FAS2820 controller module ^1^
|AFF A700 configured as an ASA 
|ASA A900 controller and NVRAM modules ^2^ 
|AFF A700 
|AFF A900 controller and NVRAM modules ^2^ 
|FAS9000 
|FAS9500 controller and NVRAM modules ^2^
|===

^1^ When replacing controller modules, you move all connections from the old to the replacement controller module.

^2^ When replacing the controller and NVRAM modules, you move only the console and management connections.

.Steps

. (AFF A800 upgrade only) At the loader prompt, enter maintenance mode: 
+
`boot_ontap maint`

.. Answer `yes` to the confirmation prompt.
.. Show the state of the 100GbE interfaces:
+
`storage port show`. 
+
All 100GbE ports connected to NS224 shelves or storage switches should report as `storage` ports, as shown in the example output below.
+
----
*> storage port show
Port Type Mode    Speed(Gb/s) State    Status  VLAN ID
---- ---- ------- ----------- -------- ------- -------
e8a  ENET storage 100 Gb/s    enabled  online  30     
e8b  ENET storage 100 Gb/s    enabled  online  30     
e11a ENET storage 100 Gb/s    enabled  online  30     
e11b ENET storage 100 Gb/s    enabled  online  30     
----

.. Exit maintenance mode:
+
`halt`

. [[A900_boot_node1]]If you have NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE) drives installed, perform the following steps.
+
NOTE: If you have not already done so earlier in the procedure, see the Knowledge Base article https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/Hardware/How_to_tell_if_a_drive_is_FIPS_certified[How to tell if a drive is FIPS certified^] to determine the type of self-encrypting drives that are in use.

.. Set `bootarg.storageencryption.support` to `true` or `false`:
+
[cols="35,65"]
|===
|If the following drives are in use…	|Then…

|NSE drives that conform to FIPS 140-2 Level 2 self-encryption requirements
|`setenv bootarg.storageencryption.support *true*`
|NetApp non-FIPS SEDs
|`setenv bootarg.storageencryption.support *false*`
|===
+
[NOTE]
====
You cannot mix FIPS drives with other types of drives on the same node or HA pair.
You can mix SEDs with non-encrypting drives on the same node or HA pair.
====

.. Go to the special boot menu and select option `(10) Set Onboard Key Manager recovery secrets`. 
+
Enter the passphrase and the backup information that you recorded earlier procedure. See link:manage_storage_encryption_using_okm.html[Manage storage encryption using the Onboard Key Manager].

.	Boot the node into the boot menu:
+
`boot_ontap menu`
.	Reassign the old node1 disks to the replacement node1 by entering "22/7" and selecting the hidden option `boot_after_controller_replacement` when the node stops at the boot menu.
+
After a short delay, you are prompted to enter the name of the node that is being replaced. If there are shared disks (also called Advanced Disk Partitioning (ADP) or partitioned disks), you are prompted to enter the node name of the HA partner.
+
These prompts might get buried in the console messages. If you do not enter a node name or enter an incorrect name, you are prompted to enter the name again.
+
[NOTE]
====
If `[localhost:disk.encryptNoSupport:ALERT]: Detected FIPS-certified encrypting drive` and, or, `[localhost:diskown.errorDuringIO:error]: error 3 (disk failed) on disk` errors occur, perform the following steps:

. Halt the node at the LOADER prompt.
. Check and reset the storage encryption bootargs mentioned in <<A900_boot_node1,Step 2>>.
. At the loader prompt, boot up:
+
`boot_ontap`

[NOTE]
====
The system IDs shown in the preceding example are example IDs. The actual system IDs of the nodes that you are upgrading will be different.

Between entering node names at the prompt and the login prompt, the node reboots a few times to restore the environment variables, update firmware on the cards in the system, and for other ONTAP updates.
