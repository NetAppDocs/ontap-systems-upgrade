| Stage | Steps

| Stage 1: Prepare for upgrade
a| . Run prechecks to verify that the operation can be performed
. Correct aggregate ownership if a precheck fails
. Input the cluster-base license keys
. Get an IP address for storage encryption
. Manage authentication using a KMIP server
. Manage storage encryption using an onboard key manager (OKM)
. Quiesce the SnapMirror relationships (optional)

Aggregate ownership at the end of Stage 1:

* Node1 is the home owner and current owner of the node1 aggregates
* Node2 is the home owner and current owner of the node2 aggregates

|Stage 2: Relocate resources from node1 and retire AFF A700 node1
a| .	Relocate non-root aggregates and NAS data LIFs owned by node1 to node2
. Relocate failed or vetoed aggregates
. Retire node1
.	Remove the AFF A700 controller module and NVS module
.	Install the AFF A900 NVS and controller module on node1
.	Netboot node 1

Aggregate ownership at the end of Stage 2:

* Node2 is the current owner of node1 aggregates
* Node2 is the home owner and current owner of node2 aggregates

|Stage 3: Boot node1 with the AFF A900 controller module NVS
a| . Boot node1 with the AFF A900 controller module and NVS
.	Verify that node1 is successfully installed
.	Restore node1 network configuration
.	Restore key-manager configuration on the upgraded node1
.	Move non-root aggregates and NAS data LIFs owned by node1 from node2 to the upgraded node1

Aggregate ownership at the end of Stage 3:

* Upgraded AFF A900 node1 is the home owner and current owner of node1 aggregates
* Node2 is the home owner and current owner of node2 aggregates

|Stage 4: Relocate resources from node2 and retire node2
a| .	Relocate non-root aggregates and NAS data LIFs from node2 to node1
.	Retire node2

Aggregate ownership at the end of Stage 4:

*	Upgraded node1 is the home owner and current owner of aggregates that originally belonged to node1
*	Node2 is the home owner of node2 aggregates
*	Upgraded node1 is the current owner of node2 aggregates

|Stage 5: Install the AFF A900 NVS and controller module on node2
a| .	Install the AFF A900 NVS and controller module on node2
.	Netboot node2

Aggregate ownership at the end of Stage 5:

*	Node1 is the home owner and current owner of the aggregates that originally belonged to node1.
*	Upgraded node2 is the home owner and current owner of aggregates that originally belonged to node2.

|Stage 6: Boot node2 with the AFF A900 controller module and NVS
a| .	Boot node2 with the AFF A900 controller module and NVS
.	Verify that node2 is correctly installed
.	Restore node2 network configuration
.	Move non-root aggregates and NAS data LIFs back to node2

|Stage 7: Complete the upgrade
a| . Verify that the new controllers are set up correctly
. Set up Storage Encryption on the new controller module
. Set up NetApp Volume Encryption on the new controller module.
. Decommission the old system.
. Resume NetApp SnapMirror operations
