[.lead]
You can nondisruptively upgrade controller hardware on a HA pair by using aggregate relocation (ARL) and converting the existing system to the replacement system, keeping the existing system chassis and disks.

ARL takes advantage of the HA configuration and cluster interconnect communication, which enables you to move ownership of non-root aggregates from one node to another if they share storage within the same cluster.

[[supported-systems]]
The following table shows the supported systems matrix for the controller upgrade.

CAUTION: This procedure strictly applies to the following upgrade configurations. Do *not* use this procedure to perform an upgrade between any other system combinations. For all other controller models, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _Use "system controller replace" commands to upgrade controller hardware running ONTAP 9.8 or later_ and the _Using aggregate relocation to manually upgrade controller hardware running ONTAP 9.8 or later_ content.

^1^ When you upgrade to a system introduced in ONTAP 9.15.1 or later, ONTAP converts the storage efficiency of all existing thin-provisioned volumes, including those not using storage efficiency, and applies the new storage efficiency features that make use of the hardware offload functionality. This is an automatic background process, with no visible performance impact to the system. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/concepts/builtin-storage-efficiency-concept.html[Learn more^].

^2^ The AFF A200 and FAS2620 systems do not support ONTAP versions later than 9.11.1.

[NOTE]
====
NetApp strongly recommends, when possible, that you have the same ONTAP version on the old and replacement systems.

The minimum ONTAP versions in the preceding table are mandatory. These ONTAP versions have the Service Processor or baseboard management controller (BMC) firmware version that is required to support mixing controller types within a chassis during an upgrade. 
====

During the procedure, you upgrade the original controller hardware with the replacement controller hardware, relocating the ownership of non-root aggregates. You migrate the non-root aggregates between the old controller nodes. After installing the replacement nodes, you migrate the non-root aggregates from the old controller nodes to the replacement controller nodes. The data hosted on the nodes that you are upgrading is accessible during the upgrade procedure. You also migrate data LIFs between nodes in the cluster as you proceed.

The controller hardware that you replace depends on the existing system model type:

|Swap the controller module on each node on the old controller with the new module. 
|AFF A700 or FAS9000
|Swap the controller and NVRAM modules on each node on the old controller with the new modules. ^1^

^1^ You don't need to move, disconnect, or reconnect the I/O cards, data cables, disk shelves, and disks.

NOTE: The terms *node1* and *node2*, are used only as a reference to node names in this document. When following the procedure, you must substitute the actual names of your nodes.

.Important information

* This procedure is complex and assumes that you have advanced ONTAP administration skills. You also should read and understand the link:guidelines_for_upgrading_controllers_with_arl.html[Guidelines for upgrading controllers] and the  link:overview_of_the_arl_upgrade.html[Overview of the ARL upgrade] sections before beginning the upgrade.
* This procedure assumes that the replacement controller hardware is new and has not been used in another system. The steps required to prepare used controllers with the `wipeconfig` command are not included in this procedure. You must contact technical support if the replacement controller hardware was previously used as part of another ONTAP cluster or as a standalone single node system.
* You can use this procedure to upgrade the controller hardware in clusters with more than two nodes; however, you need to perform the procedure separately for each HA pair in the cluster.
* If you have a switch that is not supported by the ONTAP version and the replacement system that you are upgrading to, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _Hardware Universe_.
* The AFF A70 and AFF A90 systems share 100GbE network ports for both cluster and HA connections. These systems can support 10GbE or 25GbE cluster connections to legacy cluster switches; however, NetApp recommends updating to 100GbE cluster speeds when the 10GbE and 25GbE switches are no longer required.

If you cannot link up e0a or e0b cluster ports on the existing node to the cluster ports on the new node, see the following for more information:

* The ASA A900, AFF A900, and FAS9500 systems only support high-line power (200V to 240V). If your AFF A700 or FAS9000 system is running on low-line power (100V to 120V), you must convert the AFF A700 or FAS9000 input power before using this procedure.
* If you are upgrading from an existing system with downtime that is included in the <<supported-systems-in-chassis,supported systems matrix>>, you can upgrade controller hardware by moving storage or contact technical support. Refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to _Upgrade by moving volumes or storage_.

== Automate the controller upgrade process
This procedure provides the steps for the automated procedure, which uses automatic disk assignment and network port reachability checks to simplify the controller upgrade experience.
