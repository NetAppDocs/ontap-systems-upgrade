During Stage 6, you boot node2 with upgraded system modules and verify the upgraded node2 installation. If you are using NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE), you restore key-manager configuration. You also relocate node1 non-root aggregates and NAS data LIFs from node1 to the upgraded node2 and verify that the SAN LIFs exist on node2.
