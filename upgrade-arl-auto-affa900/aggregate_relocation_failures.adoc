== Aggregates originally on node1 are owned by node2 after completion of the upgrade
At the end of the upgrade procedure, node1 should be the new home node of aggregates that originally had node1 as the home node. You can relocate them after the upgrade.

.About this task
Aggregates might fail to relocate correctly, that is, they have node2 as their home node instead of node1, under the following circumstances:

*	During Stage 3, when aggregates are relocated from node2 to node1.
+
Some of the aggregates being relocated have node1 as their home node. For example, such an aggregate could be called aggr_node_1. If relocation of aggr_node_1 fails during Stage 3, and relocation cannot be forced, then the aggregate is left behind on node2.
*	After Stage 4, when node2 is replaced with the AFF A900 controller module and NVRAM module.
+
When node2 is replaced, aggr_node_1 will come online with node1 as its home node instead of node2.

You can fix the incorrect ownership problem after Stage 6, after you have enabled storage failover by completing the following steps:

.Steps
.	Get a list of aggregates:
+
`storage aggregate show -nodes <node2> -is-home true`
+
To identify aggregates that were not correctly relocated, refer to the list of aggregates with the home owner of node1 that you obtained in the section link:prepare_nodes_for_upgrade.html[Prepare the nodes for upgrade] and compare it with the output of the above command.

.	Compare the output of Step 1 with the output you captured for node1 in the section link:prepare_nodes_for_upgrade.html[Prepare the nodes for upgrade] and note any aggregates that were not correctly relocated.
.	Relocate the aggregates left behind on node2:
+
`storage aggregate relocation start -node <node2> -aggr <aggr_node_1> -destination <node1>`
+
Do not use the -ndo-controller-upgrade parameter during this relocation.
.	Verify that node1 is now the home owner of the aggregates:
+
`storage aggregate show -aggregate <aggr1,aggr2,aggr3...> -fields home-name`
+
`<aggr1,aggr2,aggr3...>` is the list of aggregates that had node1 as the original home owner.
+
Aggregates that do not have node1 as home owner can be relocated to node1 using the same relocation command in Step 3.
