Install the AFF A90 or AFF A70 controller module that you received for the upgrade on node2. Node2 is controller B located on the lower bay of the chassis when looking at the controllers from the rear of the system.

.Steps

. On the front of the chassis, use your thumbs to firmly push each drive in to the top and bottom disk bays until you feel a positive stop. This ensures that the drives are firmly seated against the chassis midplane.

.. Go to the rear of the chassis.
. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller module halfway into the system.
+
NOTE: Don't completely insert the controller module in the chassis until instructed to do so later in the procedure.

. Cable the management and console ports to the node2 controller module.
+
NOTE: Because the chassis is already powered ON, node2 starts BIOS initialization followed by AUTOBOOT as soon as it is fully seated. To interrupt the node2 boot, before completely inserting the controller module into the slot, it is recommended that you connect the serial console and management cables to the node2 controller module.

. With the cam handle in the open position, firmly push the controller module in until it meets the midplane and is fully seated. The locking latch rises when the controller module is fully seated. Close the cam handle to the locked position.
+
NOTE: To avoid damaging the connectors, don't use excessive force when sliding the controller module into the chassis.

. Connect the serial console as soon as the module is seated and be ready to interrupt AUTOBOOT of node2.
. After you interrupt AUTOBOOT, node2 stops at the LOADER prompt. If you do not interrupt AUTOBOOT on time and node2 starts booting, wait for the prompt and press Ctrl-C to go into the boot menu. After the node stops at the boot menu, use option `8` to reboot the node and interrupt AUTOBOOT during reboot.
. At the LOADER> prompt of node2, set the default environment variables:
+
`set-defaults`

. Save the default environment variables settings:
+
`saveenv`

.  On the front of the chassis, use your thumbs to firmly push each drive in to the top and bottom disk bays until you feel a positive stop. This ensures that the drives are firmly seated against the chassis midplane.
