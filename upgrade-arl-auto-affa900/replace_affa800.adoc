At this stage, node1 is down and all data is served by node2. Because node1 and node2 are in the same chassis and powered by the same set of power supplies, do NOT power off the chassis. You must take care to remove only the node1 controller module. Typically, node1 is controller A, located on the left side of the chassis when looking at the controllers from the rear of the system. The controller label is located on the chassis directly above the controller module.

.Before you begin

* If you are not already grounded, correctly ground yourself.
* On the front of the chassis, use your thumbs to firmly push each drive in until you feel a positive stop. This ensures that the drives are firmly seated against the chassis midplane. Go to the rear of the chassis.

== Remove the AFF A800 controller module
<Insert introduction>

.Steps
. Unplug the controller module power supplies from the source.
. Release the power cable retainers, and then unplug the cables from the power supplies.
. Loosen the hook and loop strap binding the cables to the cable management device, and then unplug the system cables and SFP and QSFP modules (if needed) from the controller module, keeping track of where the cables were connected.
+
Leave the cables in the cable management device so that when you reinstall the cable management device, the cables are organized.
. Remove the cable management device from the controller module and set it aside.
. Press down on both of the locking latches, and then rotate both latches downward at the same time.
+
The controller module moves slightly out of the chassis.

. Squeeze the latch on the cam handle until it releases, open the cam handle fully to release the controller module from the midplane, and then, using two hands, pull the controller module out of the chassis.

== Install the AFF A90 or AFF A70 controller module
Use the following procedure to install the AFF A90 or AFF A70 controller module in node1.

.Steps
. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller module halfway into the system.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller module in the chassis until instructed to do so later in the procedure.
+

. Cable the management and console ports to the node1 controller module.
+
NOTE: Because the chassis is already powered ON, node1 starts BIOS initialization followed by autoboot as soon as it is fully seated. To interrupt the node1 boot, before completely inserting the controller module into the slot, it is recommended that you connect the serial console and management cables to the node1 controller module.

. With the cam handle in the open position, firmly push the controller module in until it meets the midplane and is fully seated. The locking latch rises when the controller module is fully seated. Close the cam handle to the locked position.
+
NOTE: To avoid damaging the connectors, do not use excessive force when sliding the controller module into the chassis.

. Connect the serial console as soon as the module is seated and be ready to interrupt AUTOBOOT of node1.
. After you interrupt AUTOBOOT, node1 stops at the LOADER prompt. If you do not interrupt AUTOBOOT on time and node1 starts booting, wait for the prompt and press *Ctrl-C* to go into the boot menu. After the node stops at the boot menu, use option 8 to reboot the node and interrupt the AUTOBOOT during reboot.
. At the LOADER> prompt of node1, set the default environment variables:
+
`set-defaults`

. Save the default environment variables settings:
+
`saveenv`
