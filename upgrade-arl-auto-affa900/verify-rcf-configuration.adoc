At this stage in the upgrade procedure, all data aggregates should be on node1. If you're upgrading to a configuration with switch attached clusters, you need to validate that the switch configuration on the upgraded node1 is the same as the configuration on the old node1 before the upgrade. 

If you're upgrading to a two-node switchless cluster configuration, you can skip this section and go to link:move_non_root_aggr_and_nas_data_lifs_back_to_node2.html[Move non-root aggregates and NAS data LIFs back to node2]

.Steps
. Switch to advanced privilege mode:
+
`set advanced`
. Check the status of "IC RDMA":
+
`ha interconnect status show`
+
In the output, the `IC RDMA Connection` should have the status `Up`.
