If you are using NetApp Aggregate Encryption (NAE) or NetApp Volume Encryption (NVE) to encrypt volumes on the system you are upgrading, the encryption configuration must be synchronized to the new nodes. If you do not resynchronize the key-manager, when you relocate the node1 aggregates from node2 to the upgraded node1 by using ARL, failures might occur because node1 does not have the required encryption keys to bring encrypted volumes and aggregates online.

.About this task

Synchronize the encryption configuration to the new nodes by performing the following steps:

.Steps

. Run the following command from node1:
+
`security key-manager onboard sync`

. Verify that the SVM-KEK key is restored to "true" on node1 before you relocate the data aggregates:
+
----
::> security key-manager key query -node node1 -fields restored -key-type SVM-KEK
