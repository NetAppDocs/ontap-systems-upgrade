You must have a grounding strap to perform the upgrade, and you need to reference other documents during the upgrade process.

For an AFF A800 upgrade to an AFF A90 or AFF A70, verify that the 100GbE cables are a minimum of one meter in length.

Refer to link:other_references.html[References] to access the list of reference documents and reference sites required for this upgrade.
