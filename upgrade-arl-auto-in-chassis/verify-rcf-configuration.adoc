At this stage in the upgrade procedure, all data aggregates should be on node1. If you're upgrading a configuration with switch-attached clusters, you need to validate that the cluster switch reference configuration file (RCF) supports the shared cluster/HA ports for the new controllers.  

If you're upgrading to a two-node switchless cluster configuration, you can skip this section and go to link:move_non_root_aggr_and_nas_data_lifs_back_to_node2.html[Move non-root aggregates and NAS data LIFs back to node2].

.Steps
. Switch to advanced privilege mode:
+
`set advanced`
. Check the status of "IC RDMA":
+
`ha interconnect status show`
+
In the output, the "IC RDMA Connection" should have the status `Up`.
