[.lead]
To retire node2, you shut down node2 correctly and then remove it from the rack or chassis.

== Resume the system controller replace operation 

.Steps

. Resume the operation:
+
`system controller replace resume`
+
The node halts automatically.

== Remove the AFF A800 or AFF C800 controller module

Remove the cable management device from the existing module and move the controller slightly out of the chassis.

.Before you begin
If you are not already grounded, correctly ground yourself.


.Steps
. Prepare to remove the controller module:
.. On the front of the chassis, use your thumbs to firmly push each drive in to the top and bottom disk bays until you feel a positive stop. This ensures that the drives are firmly seated against the chassis midplane.

.. Go to the rear of the chassis.
. Unplug the node2 controller module power supplies from the source.
. Release the power cable retainers, and then unplug the cables from the power supplies.
. Loosen the hook and loop strap binding the cables to the cable management device, and then unplug the system cables and SFP and QSFP modules (if needed) from the controller module, keeping track of where the cables were connected.
+
Leave the cables in the cable management device so that when you reinstall the cable management device, the cables are organized.
. Remove the cable management device from the controller module and set it aside.
. Press down on both of the locking latches, and then rotate both latches downward at the same time.
+
The controller module moves slightly out of the chassis.



.After you finish

You can decommission node2 after the upgrade is completed. See link:decommission_old_system.html[Decommission the old system].
